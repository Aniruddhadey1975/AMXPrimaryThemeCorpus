The pieces feature the iconic logo and silhouette of Apple devices like iPhones; laptops; and iPads taken apart to expose the intricate components underneath.

The X reart Apple Watch 1st Generation Frame has a list price of $219.00 but is currently on sale for $199.00 from xreart.com. I would recommend it to any Apple fan.,Xreart does a tear-down of classic electronic devices and frames them as artwork.,"In recent years; there has been an ever-growing trend of artwork featuring deconstructed Apple products. These pieces often feature the iconic logo and silhouette of Apple devices like iPhones; laptops; and iPads taken apart to expose the intricate components underneath. This type of artwork is a unique and interesting way to bring a bit of tech into your home. For people who appreciate the beauty in both high-tech gadgets and traditional artwork; this combination provides a perfect balance. Having artwork featuring deconstructed Apple products not only looks cool and modern; but it can also be meaningful in other ways.

Last year; I was introduced to this type of artwork in the form of a frame that featured a deconstructed iPhone. This artwork now hangs in my fiancé’s office and I knew that if I had the opportunity to install one for my workspace that I would choose the Apple Watch. Xreart made this possible.

Xreart is a photography studio that was established in 2019 that focuses on product photography. Xreart does a tear-down of classic electronic devices and frames them as artwork. Some of the pieces they create include iPhones; Game Boy; XBOX; Switch; PSP; and the Apple Watch. These ‘frames’ are then defined as artwork and are suitable as collectables and room decorations. They also make great gifts.

Xreart makes their frames available in two different types of wood — European Beech and Walnut. Both are more durable and scratch-resistant than other product deconstruction art pieces. They also use high-quality tempered glass as opposed to acrylic panels. This not only ensures a sophisticated look as well as a light transmission rate of 92.5%.

The Xreart frames have a specially designed back clasp to prevent the bottom lock of the frames from popping off and scratching the frames during transportation. In addition to the premade pieces; Xreart also offers DIY kits for customers to assemble their own art frames. This sets them apart from other competitors in the same space.

The Xreart Apple Watch 1st Generation Frame has a list price of $219.00 but is currently on sale for $199.00 from xreart.com.

The Xreart Apple Watch Frame arrived in a designed-style shipping box. The presentation of the product is impeccable and is one of the reasons it would make an awesome gift for any Apple fan. The frame comes with hanging hardware that is easy to use. There is no assembly required and aside from removing protective film from the front of the frame; it’s ready to be installed.

It’s a nostalgic experience having the original Apple Watch hanging on my wall. I remember jumping out of my skin when Apple announced it for the first time in 2015. I grew up watching Inspector Gadget and always wanted their communicator watches. Apple Watch made that a reality. So; the Xreart Apple Watch 1st Generation Frame was given to me.

The artwork is made well. The watch is mounted on a backboard that includes printed labels on all the parts that are exposed. Even though Apple Watch had several options for watch bands; the original Fluoroelastomer Sport Band in black is what is included with the frame. An interesting option might be for users to have the option to select the band color they want to be included. Since Xreart creates these pieces of artwork from discarded devices; I understand why giving users the option to select watch series or individual components is difficult; but I would think the watch band itself would be fairly easy to find.

Since I have already had some experience with Xreart’s competitor; GRID Studio; I naturally saw some similarities between the two pieces of artwork. I do not own the Apple Watch art from GRID; but they include detailed photos on their website. The two pieces have the same basic layout for the deconstructed Apple Watch and the biggest visual difference between the two is the quote. The GRID Studio art also includes a reproduction of Steve Jobs’s autograph; the Xreart version does not.

Another big difference between the two artwork options is that Xreart offers users the option to purchase DIY kits. The kits come complete with labeled backing; tools; and frame. I found this to be an interesting option because it gives users the opportunity to preserve their own products. I would have loved to be able to keep my first iPhone. And while I no longer have that device; I do have an original iPhone 3GS that I could tear down and mount using an Xreart kit.

I am very impressed with the quality of the Xreart’s Apple Watch Frame and I would recommend it to any Apple fan. I really love that they offer people the chance to create their own works of art with their DIY kits. I’m interested to see what Xreart offers next.

However; some research suggests that diluting the product is wise and that it may benefit one's gut microbiome; but there is some ongoing research that suggests it may also be beneficial.,While an apple a day might not actually keep the doctor away; apple cider vinegar is rich in many nutrients of its own.

The fermented juice that comes from apples has an active ingredient that experts say may marginally help with weight loss; and the product has some other health benefits; too.

But apple cider vinegar is not the magic weight loss answer some promote it to be; and some medical professionals have soured on overpromoting its benefits while research is ongoing. Still; there are at least a few known advantages of occasionally including the vinegar in one’s diet; and almost no known harms.

As its name suggests; apple cider vinegar is literally vinegar made from apples. It’s produced by pressing apples into apple juice; then allowing it to ferment.

The yeast and water blend is often mixed with sugar and has become a popular ingredient in foods such as pickles; salad dressings; and marinades. It’s sometimes sold in pill; gummy; or powder form; but is most commonly purchased in grocery stores as a pasteurized; clear; and filtered product.

An unfiltered form of the liquid is also available. This type includes a thick; cloudy layer of probiotic bacteria on the surface of the vinegar known as “the mother.”

What are the health benefits of apple cider vinegar?

“The mother” layer of apple cider vinegar contains probiotics that are promoted as being good for gut health; but supporting research is sparse. Acetic acid is the main active ingredient in apple cider vinegar (and in other types of vinegar) and has been associated with positive health outcomes such as reducing some risk factors associated with heart disease.

Josh Redd; NMD; author of “The Truth About Low Thyroid;” says additional research shows consuming apple cider vinegar may also help lower cholesterol; “particularly in people with Type 2 diabetes.” The vinegar is also rich in magnesium; potassium; phosphorus; and calcium; which are essential minerals for health and proper organ function. And apple cider vinegar is packed with antioxidants that scavenge free radicals from one’s blood cells to prevent or reduce illness or disease.

Can apple cider vinegar help you lose weight?

Apple cider vinegar has also been connected with aiding weight loss. Such assertions usually include a small study that found that consuming the vinegar could prevent obesity by improving metabolism and inflammation issues. Lisa Young; PhD; an adjunct professor of nutrition at New York University and author of “Finally Full; Finally Slim;” says the vinegar has also been shown to “increase feelings of fullness which in turn can decrease appetite.” She says the suggested amount of apple cider vinegar to take daily should be no more than 1-2 tablespoons.

“Consuming apple cider vinegar with meals may also help reduce blood sugar spikes and improve insulin sensitivity; which can help promote weight loss;” explains Redd; but adds that such research is ongoing. Until more conclusive results come in; he says one can still glean some of the other health benefits of the product safely so long as doses remain small. Even then; “because of its high acidity; apple cider vinegar can erode tooth enamel over time and should be diluted with water;” he suggests.

Barbara Olendzki; RD; associate professor of population and quantitative health sciences at UMass Chan Medical School; agrees that diluting the product is wise and says that while the vinegar is “no magic bullet” against obesity; there is some ongoing research that suggests it may beneficially help one’s gut microbiome. “And that is very important in losing weight;” she says.

You can pick one up; saving $40 in the process; from Amazon; Best Buy; or Walmart. If you have a compatible iPad; then Apple’s second-gen Pencil is the best stylus option for note-taking and drawing. Yes; there are third-party clones out there that can do a lot of what the Pencil offers for much less; but they can’t match Apple’s convenient software integrations with its own accessory — like easily checking its battery level when charging or a fancy hover feature on M2-equipped iPad Pros.

If you have an older iPad or a current 10th-gen iPad; the original Apple Pencil is also on sale for its respectively lowest of $79 ($20 off) at Amazon and Best Buy. The first-gen Pencil is a fine stylus; though it remains plagued by awkward charging. You either have to plug it into a Lightning port (if your iPad has one) or use a USB-C adapter. At least that adapter is now bundled with the first-gen Pencil; as it’s necessary for anyone using it with a 10th-gen iPad.

Spring cleaning time may be a good time to clean up your home Wi-Fi network with a nice upgrade.

Lastly; those with very large houses or floor plans that kill Wi-Fi signals can get a three-pack for $428.99 ($121 off) from the same deal.

These are the second-best prices of all time on Eero’s flagship mesh routers; which support 6GHz Wi-Fi for faster speeds on the latest devices with less network traffic for them to compete on. They’re ideal for people with gigabit internet or faster who want a little futureproofing. Read our review.

Prepaid memberships to Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription are on sale right now at Amazon. You can get a one-month prepaid digital voucher for $11.99 ($4 off) or three months for $35.99 ($9 off). We usually cover Game Pass deals from sites like Eneba or CDKeys; sometimes for lower prices; but you don’t always see these solid savings on stackable vouchers at a retailer like Amazon.

A subscription to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate gets you access to over 100 games on both Xbox Series X / S consoles and Windows PC; as well as access to Xbox online multiplayer. It includes some classics like the Halo: The Master Chief Collection; critical successes like Hi-Fi Rush; and day-one releases like Redfall. In fact; with Redfall launching tomorrow; you can potentially play it for a full month for just $11.99. Not bad for a AAA game from Arkane Studios Austin.

For those that game on an Xbox Series X or Series S; Seagate’s Storage Expansion Cards have dropped to a new low price. The plug-in 1TB SSD is now selling for $149.99 ($70 off) at Amazon; Target; and Adorama; and the 2TB version is $279.99 ($120 off) at Amazon and Target. Yes; these are still expensive accessories — especially compared to what standard M.2 SSDs for the PlayStation 5 cost — but it’s the trade-off the current Xbox consoles and their proprietary format made for the sake of convenience. At least these price drops have gotten more aggressive since a leak hinted at a cheaper option from Western Digital coming soon.",zububrothers.com,0.050236452,0.031483255,0.9182803,VRM,[],True,,0

Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring sees little surprises in store for the June quarter; but believes that the Street is being conservative on gross margins; while other catalysts such as the anticipated AR/VR headset launch at WWDC in June and easing FX should help drive gross margins to new record highs each quarter into early CY24; and reaccelerating iPhone shipment and revenue growth in FY24. Woodring also maintains a $180 price target; suggesting the shares will see modest growth of 6% over the coming months. Most on the Street are in favor of scooping up AAPL shares; and the stock’s Strong Buy consensus rating is based on 23 Buys; 4 Holds and 1 Sell.,Most of the Big Tech contingent reported March quarter earnings last week with one notable absence: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) – the biggest Big Tech of them all – will de...,"Most of the Big Tech contingent reported March quarter earnings last week with one notable absence: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) – the biggest Big Tech of them all – will deliver its fiscal second quarter statement once the the market action stops on Thursday (May 4th).

Looking ahead to the print; Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring sees little surprises in store for the quarter; anticipating $91.9 billion in revenue and EPS of $1.41; estimates which sit 1-2% below consensus. The only notable last-minute changes are a modification to iPhone revenue – pushed 2% higher to $50.3 billion; countered by a 10% cut to Mac revenue; down to $6.3 billion; and a Services revenue estimate drop of 1% to $20.9 billion.

However; it is for the June quarter; where Woodring’s take differs substantially from the Street’s forecast. For FQ3; Woodring anticipates $80 billion in revenue compared to consensus at $85 billion. To Woodring; Street iPhone forecasts in the June quarter look “too aggressive relative to the more tepid demand environment globally.”

That said; on the other hand; Woodring thinks the Street is being conservative on gross margins; calling for 44.1% vs. the consensus estimate of 43.7% with the Street not properly factoring in an “incrementally more favorable FX.” According to Woodring’s talks with clients; the soft revenue guide is actually “well-known and expected.” So; should Apple come good on the consensus gross and operating margins front; that could counter an anticipated revenue miss and will not necessarily be a “negative catalyst.”

In fact; with 4 pending catalysts on the horizon; Woodring thinks investors could do with looking beyond the June quarter metrics completely.

What are these catalysts; then? “1) the anticipated AR/VR headset launch at WWDC in June;2) reaccelerating Services growth in the June quarter;3) easing FX compares that should help to drive gross margins to new record highs each quarter into early CY24; and 4) reaccelerating iPhone shipment and revenue growth in FY24.”

Add into the mix the possible launch of a hardware subscription program; and the catalysts are why Woodring calls Apple a Top Pick and sticks with an Overweight (i.e.; Buy) rating. Woodring also maintains a $180 price target; suggesting the shares will see modest growth of 6% over the coming months. (To watch Woodring’s track record; click here)

Should the shares show any post-earnings “weakness;” Woodring says investors should scoop them up.

Most on the Street are also in favor of scooping up AAPL shares. The stock’s Strong Buy consensus rating is based on 23 Buys; 4 Holds and 1 Sell. However; having already delivered year-to-date gains of 31%; the $174.85 average target leaves room for just a 3% uptick from current levels. (See Apple stock forecast)

Apple announced on May 1 that The Morning Show will be getting a fourth season. While that may not be surprising; this news comes months before the Season 3 premiere on Apple TV+.

Created by Jay Carson and inspired by the book Top of the Morning: Inside the Cutthroat World of Morning TV; The Morning Show portrays life on the set of a network morning news program. The #MeToo movement is featured in the show; which gives the show a sense of relevancy.

The series is executive produced by stars Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston; Mimi Leder (who has also directed episodes of the series); and Charlotte Stoudt (who is the showrunner). The Morning Show is a Media Res; Hello Sunshine; and Echo Films production.

Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston once again return to the series for the third season and have added some more A-listers including Jon Hamm; Nicole Beharie; Tig Notaro; Stephen Fry; and Natalie Morales. Julianna Margulies will return in Season 3.

The Morning Show has been a part of Apple TV+’s programming since day one; premiering on November 1; 2019; along with For All Mankind and See. It was the streamer’s first drama series and has continued on in the years since and has been nominated for 11 Emmys — winning one.

Clearly; Apple has a lot of faith in The Morning Show to continue its impressive run as one of its staple shows. We’ll have to wait until the fall to see where the story goes next and even longer before the fourth season.

What will be the primary themes of the conference,"All Apple Watch users will watch WWDC news in 2023; and then find out what Apple is planning for watchOS 10. What will be the primary themes of the conference promises to revolutionize the user experience of this wearable.

In the latest edition of Mark Gurmans Power on report; it tells how the watchOS 10 will be the largest update in years. Because Apple is preparing to give priority to the widgets on the interface of its smartwatch.

Widgets will be an important component of the Apple Watch console.

Apple could easily change its watch to the next game of a watch. Now; the well-known Bloomberg analyst says what will be a major announcement brought by watchOS 10.

As it’s already said; a widget will be back on the Apple Watch; now as your user experience goes back to its present state. They will allow users to access the most important information through these gadgets.

According to Mark Gurman; the new widgets are a combination of the Glances of the early days of watchOS and the style of widgets we know from iOS 14. The aim is to allow users to take a look at various information through these interactive shortcuts.

This means information like physic activity tracking; stock indexes; news; calendar appointments and much more. So; users won’t have to open a specific application for access to such data.

The new watchOS 10 interface will remind the Siri display; launched in watchOS 4. However; you could use more widgets to easily navigate the information used in the software.

Widgets are so important in the watchOS 10 interface that Apple will change the Apple Watch Digital Crown shortcut. Instead of taking you directly on the app list; you’ll become the shortcut to all your widgets.

This will change the apple watch user experience much less by default. Since there are two-thirds of the london company; the liar says.

Quartz is your new PT powered by Artificial Intelligence.

Mark Gurman; now known only as Quartz; talks about a new Apple fitness service. That will be a digital personal trainer that uses Artificial Intelligence to develop personalized training plans.

This will be paid services built into Apple Watch and Apple’s iPhone. Using the data collected by both platforms; Quartz can track the progress of your training goals to the highest possible level.

All news should be official within the scope of this years WWDC conference. The event with programmers will begin on June 5th with the annual conference where the new Apple program will be unveiled to the world.",game-news24.com,0.045099985,0.021199953,0.9337001,Ron,[],True,,0

If you’re sensitive to glare; or you do production work where lighting is critical; opt for the Nano-texture–but this option adds to the price of the display.

What are the stand options?

Apple offers three types of stands for the Studio Display:
• Tilt-adjustable stand: Allows for only the adjustment of the display’s tilt. This comes standard with the Studio Display.

The upcoming watchOS 10 will apparently center on widgets as a core feature of the watch’s interface.

The Apple Watch rolled out in 2015 with a unique widgets interface dubbed Glances that was eventually phased out in favor of an interface more geared towards multitasking.

Instead; one’s notifications took priority over widgets and users would have to open up an app to get the information they need.

Apple is now working on an interface that combines the “old watchOS Glances system and the style of widgets that were introduced in iOS 14 on the iPhone;” per Gurman’s report.

The new design would allow users to utilize widgets for functions like checking the weather or looking at the calendar; bypassing the need for them to locate and open an app.

Gurman says that the revamped watchOS “will be reminiscent of the Siri watch face (shown above) introduced in watchOS 4.” It’s still unknown; however; when exactly Apple plans to roll out the alleged software update.

Musk just recently weighed in on Apple’s market presence and the operational implications thereof; responding to a tweet from Ek. Of course; the latter exec has for some time been speaking out against App Store fees and policies; and the Spotify co-founder last month traveled to Washington to lobby against “Apple’s stranglehold.”

Meanwhile; Musk himself spoke publicly about the App Store and its owner shortly after purchasing Twitter; when Apple temporarily paused advertising on the social media platform. Then; Musk in late November of 2022 indicated that he’d had a “good conversation” with Apple CEO Tim Cook; discussing; among other things; “the misunderstanding about Twitter potentially being removed from the App Store.”

But the South Africa-born businessman has once again taken aim at Apple; as initially mentioned; and this latest criticism looks to have been set in motion by an announcement message about Twitter subscriptions.

“Note; it takes a few days longer for subscriptions to go active on iPhone vs web; as all subscriptions currently have to be approved by Apple;” Musk penned late last month.

“This is absurd… How would this scale with every creator on every platform on the internet?” Ek asked in a follow-up tweet two days later. “And what about if a platform thought the right fee was 0% or 10% instead of Apple’s 30%?”

“This is becoming a serious scaling challenge;” Musk replied shortly thereafter.

Though it’s unclear how many additional lawmaker sit downs are on the horizon for Musk (who met with Senator Chuck Schumer to discuss artificial intelligence last week); it goes without saying that his comments about and qualms with Apple could prove significant moving forward.

Moreover; Musk today expressed the belief that Apple’s little-used Twitter profile “would have many more followers if it posted content;” tweeted his plans to try out Spotify’s AI DJ; and even voiced his opinion on Ed Sheeran’s ongoing copyright infringement trial.

Worth highlighting in conclusion is that Apple scored a victory in its antitrust showdown with Fortnite developer (and Bandcamp owner) Epic Games about one week back.

Deal with apps with notifications; health and different options round it. With the upcoming launch of WatchOS 10; nonetheless; it seems to be like Apple is gearing up for an expertise extra akin to Google’s Put on OS 3.

As reported Bloomberg Mark Gurman This previous weekend; Apple is engaged on a redesign of its watchOS platform for the Apple Watch. This tenth iteration of the platform is claimed to have “vital modifications” from current variations; notably a deal with widgets over apps. Mark Gurman defined.

It will work with any watch face and works similar to the widget stacks on iOS for telephones. Accessing widgets would apparently take the place of the Digital Crown ‘click on’ on the aspect of the machine. That motion is at present mapped to the app drawer; so that is actually a radical shift for the expertise.

Gurman illustrated the performance on Twitter and 9 to five Mac has additional bother to come back.

And certainly; this seems to be loads like Google’s present Put on OS 3 interface.

In Put on OS because it stands as we speak; the watch face has widgets referred to as “Tiles” on the left or proper aspect of a scrolling menu that’s customizable by the consumer. Widgets embrace salient or sensible data; together with climate; inventory indicators; calendars and extra; identical to Gurman studies are coming to the Apple Watch.

Apparently; the principle distinction between Apple Watch widgets is that they are buried below a button press; the place on Put on OS they’re accessible by swiping in any course. In Put on OS; urgent the facility button (or the crown) opens the app drawer.

The opposite factor Apple’s introduction will nearly actually change is third-party assist. Whereas Put on OS widgets assist third-party apps; it’s miles from widespread. It principally appears to be standard for health apps and first-party apps on non-Google Put on OS watches. The overwhelming majority of third-party Put on OS apps; even newer ones; ignore the function. So actually; Apple’s elevated emphasis on one thing that Put on OS is already prepared for could possibly be good for Google’s platform in the long term.

After all; it is humorous looking back that Apple technically had this function first. Again in 2014; the Apple Watch supported “Glances;” which may convey “related notifications” for every app by a customized interface. However Apple finally threw within the towel on Glances in watchOS 3; two years earlier than Google launched Tiles to older variations of Put on OS.",1patogh.com,0.04189529,0.035712667,0.9223921,sultan,[],True,,0

What is going on?

Apple is working on a new screen for Apple Watch

The rumors that Apple is working on a new type of screen have been going on for some time. All versions of the Apple Watch now have an OLED screen; but in the future this should become a micro-LED screen. This new screen would be used by Apple from 2024; but has now been postponed again. Displays expert Ross Young now expects the screen to arrive at the end of 2025.

Read also: Apple Watch gets a new screen (and that’s better than OLED)

The future model of the Apple Watch Ultra will therefore still have to make do with an OLED screen. It was previously expected that the successor to the current Apple Watch Ultra would be Apple’s first device with a micro-LED screen. That plan is now off the table. But why exactly?

The fact that Apple has now chosen to postpone the new micro-LED screens is probably due to technical problems. It is quite difficult to make these screens and the costs of this production process are very high. So it’s up to Apple to find a way to make the screens affordable.

Apple plans to provide all iPhones; iPads and Macs with its own micro-LED screens in the future. Now the company is still dependent on; for example; Samsung and LG for the production of all screens. However; the big challenge when extending micro-LED to multiple devices is the size of the (expensive) screen. That is why Apple is first bringing micro-LED to the smaller devices.

By producing micro-LED screens itself; Apple is therefore less dependent on other companies; but this is not the only advantage. For example; micro-LED screens have brighter and brighter colors. The screens also get a wider viewing angle. This way; you can still clearly see the time on your Apple Watch with the new screen; even from the most slanted angle.

The colors of these screens also remain good for a long time. This is the biggest advantage of micro-LED: the quality of the screen is guaranteed and does not deteriorate after a while; as is the case with OLED. Sustainability is such a big advantage of micro LED. This way; your Apple Watch will last a little longer with the new screen.

So it will be a while before Apple introduces the new screens with the Apple Watch. Don’t feel like waiting for these micro LED screens and don’t have an Apple Watch yet? Or is your current Apple Watch really in need of an upgrade? Then check out the Apple Watch price comparison iPhonedso that you can be sure that you are paying the lowest price.

The Apple Watch Series 8 and the Apple Watch Ultra are the latest smartwatches from Apple. Do you think it’s too expensive? Then the Apple Watch SE 2022 is a great alternative!

That action is currently mapped to the app drawer; so this is certainly a radical shift for the experience.

Gurman illustrated the functionality on Twitter; and 9to5Mac has a further breakdown of what’s coming.

And; really; this feels much like the current interface of Google’s Wear OS 3.

In Wear OS as it exists today; the watch face has widgets – called “Tiles” – to either the left or right in a rotating list that’s customizable by the user. Widgets include glanceable or actionable information that includes weather; stock tickers; calendars; and more; just as Gurman reports is coming to the Apple Watch.

The main difference on Apple Watch widgets; it seems; is that these are buried beneath a button click; where on Wear OS they’re available with a swipe in either direction. On Wear OS; pressing the power button (or crown) opens the app drawer.

The other thing that Apple’s implementation will almost surely change is third-party support. While Wear OS widgets support third-party apps; it’s far from widely used. Mostly; it seems to be popular for fitness apps and first-party apps on non-Google Wear OS watches. The vast majority of third-party Wear OS apps; even new ones; ignore the feature. So; really; Apple putting more emphasis on something that Wear OS happens to already have ready to go could be good for Google’s platform in the long run.

Of course; it’s funny to look back at the fact that Apple technically had this feature first. As far back as 2014; the Apple Watch supported “Glances;” which could bring out “relevant notifications” through a custom UI for each app. But; ultimately; Apple threw in the towel on “Glances” back in watchOS 3; two years before Google introduced Tiles to older Wear OS versions.",droidgazette.com,0.041448284,0.036595847,0.9219558,Alex Chen,[],True,,0

American tech company Apple is in talks with suppliers about manufacturing its MacBook laptop computers in Thailand as part of the firm’s strategy of diversifying its production and supply chains; Nikkei Asia reported last week.

“The company has also been mass producing its Apple Watch in Thailand for more than a year; which has further underscored the growing importance of the country and Southeast Asia as an alternative production base to China;” wrote Nikkei Asia.

Three separate suppliers have told Apple that they are ready and willing to start manufacturing MacBooks at their Thai plants; with at least one building in a new factory that could be used for the purpose and will be completed by the end of this year.

A senior executive at one of the suppliers told Nikkei Asia that “Ideally; Apple asked us to set up facilities in Vietnam for MacBooks; following in the footsteps of other Apple suppliers; but we offered an alternative option of building the product at our Thailand plants; which still have a massive space that can be reserved for the client.”

Apple’s manufacturing is deeply tied to China; but the company has been exploring other options following the lockdowns that had been imposed because of the pandemic; and also because of rising geopolitical tensions.

The firm has been making AirPods; the Apple Watch; iPads and MacBooks in northern Vietnam for a few years; but suppliers are recommending to Apple that Southeast Asia and Thailand in particular are good options if it would like to further diversify its production locations and supply chains.

The Sausalito houseboat was replicated on a stage in Los Angeles for the inside shots; using floating walls and an interior not subject to the elements. The city is no stranger to the arts; its rich bohemian heritage goes back almost a century.,“The Last Thing He Told Me;” which centers on a family who lives in a floating home; includes many of the city’s famous sights.,"Sausalito is the backdrop of a new Apple TV+ series starring Jennifer Garner.

The show; based the bestselling novel “The Last Thing He Told Me” by Laura Dave; started on April 14 and features iconic locations such as Liberty Dock and the Marin Headlands.

“I’m always interested in highlighting a community that’s on the edge of the world in some way;” said Dave; who lives in Los Angeles. “I sort of fell in love with it. It was such a beautiful community and the people had such a sense of community there.”

The story centers on Hannah; a newly married woman played by Garner; who lives on a floating home in Sausalito with her husband Owen and his 16-year-old daughter Bailey. When Owen disappears; the pair have to bridge their tenuous relationship to solve the mystery of his disappearance.

Sausalito’s characteristics as an insulated coastal community buttressed its choice as a location in the story. Dave said the floating home neighborhood appeared to require “something different of its inhabitants” and could be a place where “someone would choose to hide.”

“Part of the journey of the show is that Sausalito is so important to the two main characters;” she said. “It’s a way to get back to the happiness that they know there.”

Opening scenes feature the Sausalito docks; the shimmering bay and rows of homes illuminated. The married couple stroll along the water and an ominous man lingers in the background. After sunrise; a red Dodge truck winds through the city interspersed with sweeping dock views; fluttering birds and a fog-laden image of the Golden Gate Bridge.

The show features locations such as Waldo Point Harbor; Yellow Ferry Dock; City Hall and Caledonia Street; along with shots of Bridgeway at Easterby Street and Princess Street. Poggio; an Italian restaurant; is mentioned as a favorite of Hannah’s.

The houseboat was used as the home of Paul Avery; the character Robert Downey Jr. played in the film “Zodiac;” and as the home of Dax Shepard’s character in the TV show “Parenthood.”

“People have just really embraced the book and seem to love how Sausalito is portrayed; which means a lot to me;” Dave said.

Josh Singer; Dave’s husband and a producer for the show; previously worked as a writer on “The West Wing” and “Fringe.” As showrunner; he worked with the writers to generate a script and oversaw its development to the screen.

Singer said the Sausalito houseboat was replicated on a stage in Los Angeles for the inside shots; using floating walls and an interior not subject to the elements.

“Sausalito leaves a very strong imprint on the viewer;” Singer said. “We really wanted to get a sense of place and a sense of community in Sausalito.”

The city is no stranger to the arts. Its rich bohemian heritage goes back almost a century; said Louis Briones; executive director of the Sausalito Art Festival Foundation and co-director of Sausalito Center for the Arts.

An established art center in the city drew visual artists in the 1930s. The “Sausalito Six” — Richard Diebenkorn; Frank Lobdell; Walter Kuhlman; John Hultberg; James Budd Dixon and George Stillman — dominated headlines as a collective in the late 1940s. Jean Varda led the city’s reputation as an art colony on the waterfront; Briones said.

“It continues with organizations like the Sausalito Art Festival and Sausalito Center for the Arts; which has taken the mantle;” Briones said. “We’re moving the art colony’s history forward.”

Cheryl Popp; owner of Sausalito Books by the Bay; said Dave did book signings at the shop.

“Obviously Sausalito offers an absolutely stunning set and stage from any sort of novel. What more inspirational place to write a book or film a movie?” Popp said.

The famed Marin author Isabel Allende has featured the city in many of her books. Other authors to do include Jack London and Jack Kerouac. Sterling Hayden; the 1950s and 1960s actor; was a resident of the city and set much of his memoir; “The Wanderer;” there. Barbara Sapienza wrote a novel called “Anchor Out” set in Richardson Bay; and Rick Seymour’s “Murder on the Dock of the Bay” is also set in Sausalito.

The Jean Varda-era attracted Beat writers Allen Ginsberg; Gary Snyder and Rod McKuen; who wrote an ode titled “Back to Sausalito.”

“We are thrilled to see this thriller showcase our picturesque; charming village to the world through an Apple TV+ series;” said Mayor Melissa Blaustein. “To us; it’s home; not a movie set; but I can see why a film director would think otherwise.”",marinij.com,0.04608191,0.053743836,0.90017426,Giuseppe Ricapito,"[{'country': 'us', 'state': 'CA', 'county': 'Marin County'}]",False,CA,0

The goal of the installation is to create a space where visitors can share their ideas about a dynamic; and growing city. The duo wanted to create an interactive and collaborative experience that celebrates the diversity and energy of the city while fostering a sense of connection and community.

They also used cutting-edge technology to create the user-friendly interface that is both fast and reliable.

The goal of the installation is to create a space where visitors can share their ideas about a dynamic; and growing city. The artists say they wanted to ensure that 'Mumbai Rising' provides an interactive and engaging experience that encourages collaboration and inspires creativity.

""The focus had to be on showcasing the city's energy; momentum; community and connection. The final design should incorporate innovation and a user-friendly interface to ensure a seamless and enjoyable experience for all participants -- that was the brief we received;"" they tell IANS.

While their focus has always been on using technology to create unique experiences that inspire audiences to think outside the box; for this project; they wanted to create a safe and inclusive space where people could share their ideas and perspectives on the city.

""We envision an installation that encourages exploration and allows thousands of people to contribute their own unique expressions. The installation has been built around eight prompts that are centred around emotions; paradise; dreams; song; rain; speed; kaali peeli; and Bombay. These prompts will serve as a poetic narrative that invites visitors to collectively explore and define the city we call home;"" says Tagra.

Adding that their goal is to create an interactive and collaborative experience that celebrates the diversity and energy of the city while fostering a sense of connection and community; Thukral says; ""To achieve this; we used innovative technology and design an intuitive user interface to ensure that visitors can easily engage with the installation and share their ideas in a meaningful way.""

The project required a high-speed interaction between the user and the algorithm; to generate unique imagery based on the user's inputs. The user experience is critical to the success of the installation. Thukral says their goal was to create an interface that seamlessly integrates aesthetics and functionality; allowing users to interact with the installation in a way that is both engaging and visually satisfying.

To achieve this; they used cutting-edge technology to create a responsive interface that is both fast and reliable. ""We partnered with creative coder; Kiel M; to help us develop an engine. Overall; our aim was to create an installation that meets the highest standards of aesthetics and functionality; while also delivering a truly memorable and engaging user experience;"" says Thukral.

Stressing that they choose projects that allow them to get outside their comfort zones and which offer something new to learn; Tagra asserts; ""We like to push our understanding. We try different mediums to expand the scope of what art can do. it's a deep dive sometimes the results are extremely satisfying.""

Commenting on a wide array of themes -- consumerism; GST; water woes; farmers' distress; the duo belongs to a select group of artists not holding back when commenting on the contemporary social and political scenario.

Thukral believes art is a powerful marker of time; reflecting the social; cultural; and political context in which it is created. ""As artists; must respond to the world around us and engage with the issues and concerns of our time. We come from humble middle-class backgrounds and have always believed in staying grounded by connecting with grassroots-level projects. We understand the importance of engaging with the communities that inspire our work; and we believe that it is through these connections that we can create art that is meaningful and impactful.""

Adding that they recognise that times are changing and that their ways of working must evolve to stay relevant and effective; Tagra believes it is essential to be part of the system to bring about meaningful change. ""And we are committed to using our art to challenge the status quo. Ultimately; we see our work as a way of connecting with others; sparking dialogue and engagement; and of inspiring people to see the world in a new and exciting way.""

The project with Apple also took them back to their archives where they revisited their work of the past two decades.

The duo says it was exciting to draw on their own archive of artworks as a starting point for the installation as the same contains a wealth of fragments and pieces that we have carefully researched and built up over the years; each one capturing a different aspect of the city of Mumbai and its many layers.

From the basalt rock that forms the bedrock of the city; to the species found in Rani Bagh botanical gardens; to the works based on speculation and dreams; their archives boasted of a broad and diverse range of inspiration for this project. ""By combining these elements in new and unexpected ways; we hope to bring a sense of wonder and excitement to the city on the move; inspiring visitors to see it with fresh eyes and engage with its many facets;"" says Thukral.

Tagra adds that every time they delve into their archives; they are struck by the overwhelming sense of history and reverie that it contains. ""It is a living record of the city's past; present; and future; and we are honoured to have the opportunity to draw on it to create something truly unique and special. We believe that by sharing our archive with visitors; we can open up new possibilities for dialogue; engagement; and understanding; and we look forward to seeing the many ways in which it will inspire and inform this project.""

For them; it has always been fascinating to create a work that gets 'completed' when it is inhabited or activated in some way. Their latest installation explores the idea of creating a 'song' that can only be heard when the space is inhabited or engaged with by visitors.

""The concept of this work is based on the idea that sound is not just something that we hear; but something that we feel and experience. By creating a space that is designed to be activated by visitors; we hope to create a rich and immersive sensory experience that captures the essence of the city on the move;"" say the duo who is also working on new gameplays; another book and researching for a new show at Sharjah later this year.",latestnews.fresherslive.com,0.11734261,0.014759041,0.86789834,IANS,[],True,,0

Masimo sought as much as $1.85 billion; claiming that was the amount of illegal profit Apple earned from using its technology. But jurors in federal court in Santa Ana; California; told the judge Monday they were unable to reach a consensus; with six out of seven panelists voting to clear the iPhone maker of wrongdoing.

“We’re not going to be able to come to a joint conclusion;” the all-female panel wrote in its final note to the judge. Earlier; the jury said six of its members voted for Apple and one for Masimo; and she refused to change her mind. US District Judge James Selna declared a mistrial late Monday afternoon.

It’s unusual for jurors to report on a vote in their closed-door deliberations as judges routinely warn them against doing so.

Masimo Corp. and Cercacor Laboratories Inc.; a Masimo spinoff that owns certain licensing rights to many Masimo patents; sued Apple claiming it misappropriated trade secrets related to technology that uses light sensors to measure the amount of oxygen in the bloodstream for use in its Apple Watch.

Masimo initially sought as much as $3.1 billion; claiming that was the amount Apple improperly benefited from its technology. The judge rejected several of Masimo’s claims before the jury began deliberations; reducing the potential maximum payout Apple faced to $1.85 billion.

Apple poached Masimo and Cercacor employees to learn about its technology after Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook nixed an internal proposal to buy the company; Masimo’s lawyer; Joseph Re; told the jury in closing arguments.

Apple responded by brining forward numerous employees who had worked on the sensor project; all of whom told the jury during the three-week trial that Masimo’s technology wasn’t used in the development.

In his closing argument; Apple’s lawyer; Joe Mueller; invited the employees one by one to stand; repeating over and over they “told you the truth.”

After the mistrial was declared Apple thanked the jury in a statement.

“We deeply respect intellectual property and innovation and do not take or use confidential information from other companies;” the company said. “We are pleased that the court correctly rejected half of the plaintiffs’ trade secret allegations; and will now ask the court to dismiss the remaining claims.”

Re declined to comment on the mistrial and said it was too early to say if Masimo would seek another trial.

“It’s been a very emotional day;” he said.

The 3 1/3 days of jury deliberations were also marked by emotion.

In a note last week; the jury said one of the panelists would leave the room and pace the hallway outside; while another juror cried.

A Masimo spokesperson said in a statement that the company was “disappointed that the jury was unable to reach a verdict” but intends to retry the case.

The jury in federal court in Santa Ana had been asked to determine whether Cupertino; California-based Apple misused confidential information from Masimo related to the use of light to measure biomarkers including heart rates and blood oxygen levels.

The jury began deliberating on April 26 after a trial lasting about three weeks before US District Judge James Selna.

Apple said in a statement that it “deeply respects intellectual property and innovation and does not take or use confidential information from other companies;” and will ask the court to dismiss the remaining claims in the case.

Irvine; California-based Masimo and its spinoff Cercacor Laboratories Inc sued Apple in 2020; accusing it of stealing trade secrets and using them to create and sell several Apple Watch models.

The lawsuit claimed Masimo representatives met with Apple in 2013 about integrating its inventions into Apple products and that Apple subsequently hired away two executives – one from Masimo and one from Cercacor – and used their knowledge to copy the technology.

Masimo asked for more than $1.8 billion (roughly Rs. 147.17 crore) in damages; reduced from its initial request for $3.1 billion (roughly Rs. 253.45 crore) after the judge dismissed some of its trade-secret claims during trial.

Apple in a court filing called Masimo’s lawsuit a “maneuver to clear a path” for its own smartwatch. Apple sued Masimo in Delaware last year; accusing it of patent infringement.

Smartwatches; mobile devices worn on the wrist with an array of capabilities; are a lucrative market; with global sales worth tens of billions of dollars.

Masimo has also sued Apple at the US International Trade Commission over Apple Watch imports that it said violated its patent rights. An ITC judge preliminarily ruled in favor of Masimo in January; which could lead to an import ban on infringing Apple Watches if the full commission affirms the decision.

Apple is facing another potential Apple Watch import ban in a separate patent fight with Mountain View; California-based medical device maker AliveCor over heart-monitoring technology.

However; a new leak by DSCC analyst Ross Young contradicts this rumour as he claims that the Cupertino-based company will not bring microLED display technology to the Apple Watch before the second half of 2025. Apple Watch currently comes equipped with OLED displays. MicroLED display offers high resolution and colour contrast compared to OLED technology. The iPhone lineup; followed by iPad and Mac units is also expected to switch from OLED to micro-LED in the future.

DSCC analyst Ross Young tweeted that Apple would release an Apple Watch with a microLED display in the second half of 2025 at the earliest. The new leak denies past reports that claimed that the Apple Watch Ultra with microLED display will show up by the end of 2024. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman earlier in January opined that Apple would replace the current OLED standard with microLED technology in its iPhone; iPad; and Mac units from 2024 onwards.

At present; Apple uses OLED displays for its wearables. Compared to these traditional panels; the next-generation display brings improved resolution; colour contrast; and the ability to be better seen at an angle. Apple is also reportedly planning to start using its own screens for the iPhone and Apple Watch. Using in-house displays would reduce Apple’s dependency on companies like Samsung Electronics and LG.

Samsung is also reportedly eying to adopt microLED displays for its future Galaxy series wearables. The South Korean electronics manufacturer currently uses OLED displays for its Galaxy smartwatches.

As per a recent report; Samsung Display had formed a team at the end of last year to commercialise microLED displays for Galaxy smartwatches. The team reportedly eyes to complete the development within this year. Samsung’s premium smart TVs have microLED displays and these are manufactured by Samsung Electronics.",quickgunnews.com,0.14797986,0.013657156,0.838363,dewashishverma1,[],False,,0

Apple is facing another potential Apple Watch import ban in a separate patent fight with Mountain View; California's medical device maker AliveCor over heart-monitoring technology.,A US judge in California on Monday declared a mistrial in Masimo's smartwatch trade secret lawsuit against Apple Inc after jurors failed to reach a unanimous verdict in the potential billion-dollar case.,"A US judge in California on Monday declared a mistrial in Masimo’s smartwatch trade secret lawsuit against Apple after jurors failed to reach a unanimous verdict in the potential billion-dollar case.

A Masimo spokesperson said in a statement that the company was “disappointed that the jury was unable to reach a verdict” but intends to retry the case.

The jury in federal court in Santa Ana had been asked to determine whether Cupertino; California-based Apple misused confidential information from Masimo related to the use of light to measure biomarkers including heart rates and blood oxygen levels.

The jury began deliberating on April 26 after a trial lasting about three weeks before US District Judge James Selna.

Apple said in a statement that it “deeply respects intellectual property and innovation and does not take or use confidential information from other companies;” and will ask the court to dismiss the remaining claims in the case.

Irvine; California-based Masimo and its spinoff Cercacor Laboratories Inc sued Apple in 2020; accusing it of stealing trade secrets and using them to create and sell several Apple Watch models.

The lawsuit claimed Masimo representatives met with Apple in 2013 about integrating its inventions into Apple products and that Apple subsequently hired away two executives – one from Masimo and one from Cercacor – and used their knowledge to copy the technology.

Masimo asked for more than $1.8 billion (roughly Rs. 147.17 crore) in damages; reduced from its initial request for $3.1 billion (roughly Rs. 253.45 crore) after the judge dismissed some of its trade-secret claims during trial.

Apple in a court filing called Masimo’s lawsuit a “maneuver to clear a path” for its own smartwatch. Apple sued Masimo in Delaware last year; accusing it of patent infringement.

Smartwatches; mobile devices worn on the wrist with an array of capabilities; are a lucrative market; with global sales worth tens of billions of dollars.

Masimo has also sued Apple at the US International Trade Commission over Apple Watch imports that it said violated its patent rights. An ITC judge preliminarily ruled in favor of Masimo in January; which could lead to an import ban on infringing Apple Watches if the full commission affirms the decision.

The jury said six of its members voted for Apple and one for Masimo; and she refused to change her mind. Masimo initially sought as much as $3.1 billion; claiming that was the amount of illegal profit Apple improperly benefited from its technology. The judge rejected several of Masimo’s claims before the jury began deliberations; reducing the potential maximum payout Apple faced to $1.85 billion.

Masimo sought as much as $1.85 billion; claiming that was the amount of illegal profit Apple earned from using its technology. But jurors in federal court in Santa Ana; California; told the judge Monday they were unable to reach a consensus; with six out of seven panelists voting to clear the iPhone maker of wrongdoing.

“We’re not going to be able to come to a joint conclusion;” the all-female panel wrote in its final note to the judge. Earlier; the jury said six of its members voted for Apple and one for Masimo; and she refused to change her mind. US District Judge James Selna declared a mistrial late Monday afternoon.

It’s unusual for jurors to report on a vote in their closed-door deliberations as judges routinely warn them against doing so.

Masimo Corp. and Cercacor Laboratories Inc.; a Masimo spinoff that owns certain licensing rights to many Masimo patents; sued Apple claiming it misappropriated trade secrets related to technology that uses light sensors to measure the amount of oxygen in the bloodstream for use in its Apple Watch.

Masimo initially sought as much as $3.1 billion; claiming that was the amount Apple improperly benefited from its technology. The judge rejected several of Masimo’s claims before the jury began deliberations; reducing the potential maximum payout Apple faced to $1.85 billion.

Apple poached Masimo and Cercacor employees to learn about its technology after Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook nixed an internal proposal to buy the company; Masimo’s lawyer; Joseph Re; told the jury in closing arguments.

Apple responded by brining forward numerous employees who had worked on the sensor project; all of whom told the jury during the three-week trial that Masimo’s technology wasn’t used in the development.

In his closing argument; Apple’s lawyer; Joe Mueller; invited the employees one by one to stand; repeating over and over they “told you the truth.”

After the mistrial was declared Apple thanked the jury in a statement.

“We deeply respect intellectual property and innovation and do not take or use confidential information from other companies;” the company said. “We are pleased that the court correctly rejected half of the plaintiffs’ trade secret allegations; and will now ask the court to dismiss the remaining claims.”

Re declined to comment on the mistrial and said it was too early to say if Masimo would seek another trial.

“It’s been a very emotional day;” he said.

The 3 1/3 days of jury deliberations were also marked by emotion.

In a note last week; the jury said one of the panelists would leave the room and pace the hallway outside; while another juror cried.

The Hyundai Card's fees for Apple Pay are 0.15 percent of the transaction amount; while Samsung Electronics has not charged any fees for Samsung Pay. Card companies have expressed their dissatisfaction with the service; which has led to additional unexpected costs. Samsung Electronics is also expected to renew its contract with card companies from May to August.,Samsung Electronics instruct to charge fees for Samsung Pay-based payments as a consequence of Apple Pay's launch.,"Samsung Electronics has started pushing credit card companies with a scheme of deducting fees. The reason behind this groundwork measure since Apple Pay’s arrival in Korea. Notably; the Hyundai card launched the Apple Pay service is act as a medium to pay a fee to Apple. While Samsung Electronics will offer the same protocols to credit card companies that use Samsung Pay.

As per recent industry news; Samsung Electronics highlights its positions to major credit company executives. They instruct to charge fees for Samsung Pay-based payments as a consequence of Apple Pay’s launch.

Apple got fees from credit card company partners that are associated with Apple Pay. Also; the Hyundai Card’s fees for Apple Pay are 0.15 percent of the transaction amount. Samsung Electronics has not charged any fees for Samsung Pay. Now they tend to start; while the exact official statement is yet to come.

However; card companies have already expressed their dissatisfaction. “The Apple Pay service has led to additional unexpected costs;” said a card company representative; who asked not to be named; “which will inevitably lead to a decrease in cardholder revenue.” “There is a saying that Apple Pay has a fee; so the more customers use it; the more the card loses;” said another; adding; “We will negotiate with both sides (Samsung and Apple) to see what is beneficial for customers and us.”

Although various credit card companies have a distinct place in the market; Hyundai Card presumes to be hit hard. And since; Apple Pay partner; Hyundai pays fees for Apple Pay. Therefore; the probability is that Samsung pressurizes Hyundai cards in order to pay fees to Samsung Pay as well.

“Samsung Pay is one of many payment services; so it will not be easy to suddenly cancel the contract with Hyundai Card;” a Hyundai Card representative said. “We will respond according to our existing policies.” Samsung Card is a Samsung Group affiliate; so it is highly unlikely to join Apple Pay. “If Samsung Electronics makes a proposal to charge fees for Samsung Pay; we will closely study it;” said a Samsung Card representative; adding; “We will consider whether to introduce Apple Pay in consideration of situations in the market.”

Apparently; the key factor is the timing of Samsung Pay’s renewal agreements with card companies. On the other hand; Samsung Electronics is predicted to renew its contract with card companies from May to August. While the company is assumed to discuss with card companies from May to August. Thus; companies are forecasted to initiate discussions with card companies in May on the prior node.

“Samsung Pay’s conversion to a paid service is likely to be based on market shares of credit card companies;” said Seo Ji-yong; professor of business administration at Sangmyung University in Seoul. “In the future; credit card companies other than Samsung Card may check and compare customer preferences for Apple Pay and Samsung Pay and choose between the two. So it remains to be seen what results Samsung Electronics will produce in the upcoming renewal negotiations.”",samnews24.com,0.060224976,0.43131432,0.5084607,Asim Siddiqui,[],False,,0

As an Apple supplier; Wistron has been working within India for over 15 years; but that is apparently soon to change. Rather than continue to build out business in India like Foxconn is doing; the Taiwanese firm is said to be moving out.

According to sources cited by Hindu BusinessLine; Wistron will be mostly withdrawing from India; and will probably approach the National Company Law Tribunal and the Registrar of Companies to dissolve its operations within a year.

The effort has already seemingly started; with Tata Electronics seeking to take control of Wistron’s Karnataka iPhone production facility; which is also Wistron’s main operation in India.

The factory became a problem for Wistron in December 2020; after employees rioted over allegations of shorted pay. The incident led to Apple putting Wistron on probation.

Sources claim that once the takeover of the iPhone arm is complete; Wistron will start the process of winding down.

It is also said that Wistron will also wait for more subsidy payments from the Mobile PLI scheme set up by the government to encourage production; before shutting down.

While Wistron employs over 12;000 people in India; not all will lose their jobs over time. The majority of Wistron’s employees work under the iPhone unit that Tata is in the process of acquiring.

Wistron’s other interests in the country include firms in the Internet of Things market; as well as attempts to attract more notebook production and work in the electric vehicle space. However; it now seems that these won’t necessarily come to fruition; at least not in India.

There will still be some elements of Wistron active in India despite the winding-down situation. Sources say the only operations that will probably still exist in India will be its services business; set up to repair and maintain Apple products.",soundsnerdy.com,0.015295972,0.7206319,0.2640721,Sounds Nerdy,[],True,,0

Apple Savings is a high-yield savings account run by Goldman Sachs; with the front end owned by Apple. It is tied to the Apple Card and; thus; a US-only feature.

According to a report from Forbes; Apple Savings had a great first week. Anonymous sources indicate that around 240;000 accounts were created in that first week; amassing $990 million in deposits in the first four days.

“Banks have quickly responded to the Fed’s interest rate hikes with higher mortgage and car loan rates; but savers have seen little to no increase in traditional bank deposits or savings accounts;” Richard Crone; CEO and founder of payments firm Crone Consulting; says. “There’s an outflow to CDs; money market funds; and fintechs like Apple.”

Apple Savings isn’t the best high-yield savings account out there; nor does it offer the highest APY. However; it might just be the most convenient — at least for existing Apple Card holders.

That 4.15% APY combined with the simplicity of sign-up are likely influences for the large initial adoption rate. The savings account has been available for two weeks now; but adoption numbers have not been made public.

Apple is a very secretive company; so it is impossible to determine exactly how many users are able to adopt Apple Savings. Out of the 2 billion active Apple products used in the world; only a fraction of that resides in the United States — with many people owning multiple products.

Still; 240;000 new accounts would represent strong initial interest from the United States Apple user base. Each of those accounts belongs to a single adult over 18 with an Apple Card.

A mind-boggling number can be derived from that $990 million in deposits. With just the money deposited in the first four days; we know at 4.15% APY that customers will be paid $41 million in interest over the next year.

Well; this writer got six cents of that on May 1 for some perspective on the incredible numbers we’re dealing with here.

The jury said six of its members voted for Apple and one for Masimo; and she refused to change her mind.

Apple thanked the jury in a statement and will now ask the court to dismiss the remaining claims.,Apple Inc. and Masimo Corp. failed to persuade a jury to reach a unanimous verdict in a trial where the medical-devices company claimed a blood-oxygen sensor in the Apple Watch was developed using misappropriated trade secrets.,"Apple Inc. and Masimo Corp. failed to persuade a jury to reach a unanimous verdict in a trial where the medical-devices company claimed a blood-oxygen sensor in the Apple Watch was developed using misappropriated trade secrets.

Masimo sought as much as $1.85 billion; claiming that was the amount of illegal profit Apple earned from using its technology. But jurors in federal court in Santa Ana; California; told the judge Monday they were unable to reach a consensus; with six out of seven panelists voting to clear the iPhone maker of wrongdoing.

“We’re not going to be able to come to a joint conclusion;” the all-female panel wrote in its final note to the judge. Earlier; the jury said six of its members voted for Apple and one for Masimo; and she refused to change her mind. US District Judge James Selna declared a mistrial late Monday afternoon.

It’s unusual for jurors to report on a vote in their closed-door deliberations as judges routinely warn them against doing so.

Masimo Corp. and Cercacor Laboratories Inc.; a Masimo spinoff that owns certain licensing rights to many Masimo patents; sued Apple claiming it misappropriated trade secrets related to technology that uses light sensors to measure the amount of oxygen in the bloodstream for use in its Apple Watch.

Masimo initially sought as much as $3.1 billion; claiming that was the amount Apple improperly benefited from its technology. The judge rejected several of Masimo’s claims before the jury began deliberations; reducing the potential maximum payout Apple faced to $1.85 billion.

Apple poached Masimo and Cercacor employees to learn about its technology after Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook nixed an internal proposal to buy the company; Masimo’s lawyer; Joseph Re; told the jury in closing arguments.

Apple Set for Billion-Dollar Trial in Clash Over Watch Secrets

Apple responded by brining forward numerous employees who had worked on the sensor project; all of whom told the jury during the three-week trial that Masimo’s technology wasn’t used in the development.

In his closing argument; Apple’s lawyer; Joe Mueller; invited the employees one by one to stand; repeating over and over they “told you the truth.”

After the mistrial was declared Apple thanked the jury in a statement.

“We deeply respect intellectual property and innovation and do not take or use confidential information from other companies;” the company said. “We are pleased that the court correctly rejected half of the plaintiffs’ trade secret allegations; and will now ask the court to dismiss the remaining claims.”

Re declined to comment on the mistrial and said it was too early to say if Masimo would seek another trial.

“It’s been a very emotional day;” he said.

The 3 1/3 days of jury deliberations were also marked by emotion.

In a note last week; the jury said one of the panelists would leave the room and pace the hallway outside; while another juror cried.

Following the aforementioned three contenders come Mozilla Firefox and Opera Limited’s OPRA namesake internet browser with 5.65% and 3.09% of the market share.

Why It’s Important: It was previously reported that Microsoft had incorporated artificial intelligence into its Edge browser and Bing search engine; leveraging the same cutting-edge technology that OpenAI utilized in developing chatGPT.

Microsoft’s decision to take this step came in the backdrop of Google and Chrome’s dominance in search and browser segments; respectively.

Apple’s iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max will bring a party trick to the table this year: blazing-fast data speeds via their new USB-C ports. But now we not only know how fast it will be thanks to a new leak; but that it will do something no one expected.

“The port on the Pro will be Thunderbolt 3. I know there’s a lot of speculation in our community; but it’s TB3;” an anonymous insider reveals Analyst 941who leaked accurate data about Dynamic Island before the launch of the iPhone 14 Pro last year.

Thunderbolt 3 operates at up to 40 Gbps (Gigabits per second); which is equivalent to 5;000 megabytes per second (MB per second). By comparison; the lighting port on all current iPhones is limited to USB 2.0 speeds; which are 480Mbps; which is about 0.48Gbps / 60Mbps. It’s a stratospheric upgrade.

But the real surprise is that Analyst941 claims the new outlet will also produce for displays with up to 4K resolution. Obviously there will be special “features” in iOS 17 to take advantage of this; although the example given is; in their own words; a “place”:

Whether the new features could include outputting a game or movie to a standard screen or TV without Apple TV or AirPlay remains to be seen; but it opens the door to iPad Pro-style multi-screen support; which can connect to displays to expand their range. Workspace.

It’s Thunderbolt 3’s raw speed advantages that are most impressive; though. iPhone 15 Pro / Pro Max owners can potentially back up and restore their phones in minutes; and enthusiasts can quickly transfer huge files with ProRAW Photography and ProRES video create. It’s a drastic upgrade to the iPhone’s capabilities.

This is not the only change coming. Previously; leaks revealed a more curvilinear design; lightweight titanium chassis; periscope zoom camera; and possible price hikes. But it’s the inclusion of USB-C that could ultimately have the biggest impact — even if Apple is forced to do so.

Update 05/01: Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman has leaked more details about Apple’s plans for iPhones and iPads via his phone employment newsletter; and they focus on artificial intelligence. According to Gorman; Apple is working on an AI-driven virtual trainer; codenamed Quartz; which will be integrated into iPhones and Apple Watch devices and launched next year.

Gurman says that Quartz “will essentially be a coach built into your iPhone and Apple Watch. It will use artificial intelligence and data from your devices to build personalized health plans.”

This is an important play from Apple. The company has been criticized for its slow development in its AI assistant; Siri; which launched in 2011. Moreover; the news comes just weeks after special report Allegedly; Apple’s AI ambitions are severely hampered by caution and high-profile turf wars.

Needless to say; an AI trainer in isolation isn’t going to fix this; but at a time when AI-based chatbots; led by ChatGPT; are exploding in popularity; Apple needs to show this in the game. Well; that would be a step in the right direction.

Get all latest entertainment & viral stories on www.lokmattimes","San Francisco; May 2 Apple has released its first batch of publicly available ""rapid security"" patches; which are specifically designed to address security vulnerabilities that are currently being actively exploited or pose a significant risk to the safety and privacy of customers.

According to Apple; the 'Rapid Security Responses' deliver important security improvements between software updates.

""Rapid Security Responses are a new type of software release for iPhone; iPad; and Mac. They deliver important security improvements between software updates for example; improvements to the Safari web browser; the WebKit framework stack; or other critical system libraries. They may also be used to mitigate some security issues more quickly;"" according to Apple's support page.

Customers running iOS 16.4.1; iPadOS 16.4.1; and macOS 13.3.1 will receive the rapid security update.

It will add a letter to the software version once installed; such as iOS 16.4.1 (a); iPadOS 16.4.1 (a); and macOS 13.3.1 (a).

Older versions of Apple's software will not receive the quick security fix.

Users' device; by default; allows Rapid Security Responses to be applied automatically and; if necessary; will prompt them to restart it.

To check your device settings on iPhone or iPad go to Settings > General > Software Update > Automatic Updates; then make sure that ""Security Responses & System Files"" is turned on.

In Mac choose the Apple menu then System Settings and then click General in the sidebar; then click Software Update on the right.

Apple’s iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max will bring a party trick to the table this year: blazing-fast data speeds via their new USB-C ports. But now we not only know how fast it will be thanks to a new leak; but that it will do something no one expected.

“The port on the Pro will be Thunderbolt 3. I know there’s a lot of speculation in our community; but it’s TB3;” an anonymous insider reveals Analyst 941who leaked accurate data about Dynamic Island before the launch of the iPhone 14 Pro last year.

Thunderbolt 3 operates at up to 40 Gbps (Gigabits per second); which is equivalent to 5;000 megabytes per second (MB per second). By comparison; the lighting port on all current iPhones is limited to USB 2.0 speeds; which are 480Mbps; which is about 0.48Gbps / 60Mbps. It’s a stratospheric upgrade.

But the real surprise is that Analyst941 claims the new outlet will also produce for displays with up to 4K resolution. Obviously there will be special “features” in iOS 17 to take advantage of this; although the example given is; in their own words; a “place”:

Whether the new features could include outputting a game or movie to a standard screen or TV without Apple TV or AirPlay remains to be seen; but it opens the door to iPad Pro-style multi-screen support; which can connect to displays to expand their range. Workspace.

It’s Thunderbolt 3’s raw speed advantages that are most impressive; though. iPhone 15 Pro / Pro Max owners can potentially back up and restore their phones in minutes; and enthusiasts can quickly transfer huge files with ProRAW Photography and ProRES video create. It’s a drastic upgrade to the iPhone’s capabilities.

This is not the only change coming. Previously; leaks revealed a more curvilinear design; lightweight titanium chassis; periscope zoom camera; and possible price hikes. But it’s the inclusion of USB-C that could ultimately have the biggest impact — even if Apple is forced to do so.

Update 05/01: Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman has leaked more details about Apple’s plans for iPhones and iPads via his phone employment newsletter; and they focus on artificial intelligence. According to Gorman; Apple is working on an AI-driven virtual trainer; codenamed Quartz; which will be integrated into iPhones and Apple Watch devices and launched next year.

Gurman says that Quartz “will essentially be a coach built into your iPhone and Apple Watch. It will use artificial intelligence and data from your devices to build personalized health plans.”

This is an important play from Apple. The company has been criticized for its slow development in its AI assistant; Siri; which launched in 2011. Moreover; the news comes just weeks after special report Allegedly; Apple’s AI ambitions are severely hampered by caution and high-profile turf wars.

Needless to say; an AI trainer in isolation isn’t going to fix this; but at a time when AI-based chatbots; led by ChatGPT; are exploding in popularity; Apple needs to show this in the game. Well; that would be a step in the right direction.

With that there are also reveals that the Apple WatchOS 10 will be coming with significant differences in the software.

This update can be considered as one of the greatest changes in the lineup of Apple Watch lineup since their launch in 2015. So; let’s look into the updates that have been suggested.

So; according to the reveals the Apple Watch will be bringing back widgets; which will have the old Glances system along with the widgets that will be coming in with the iOS 14. The users will be able to go through and get information with the help of these widgets instead of keeping multiple tabs or apps open at once.

These Apple Watch widgets will also come in with features like activity tracking; weather; stock tickets; calendar and so on. This will come up as an overlay for the Watch faces. Also; there are rumours that users can access widgets by pressing the Digital Crown which presently just takes them back to the home screen.

The reveal also gives hints at an AI-powered health coach which will be later introduced in the coming year. But this will be included in the smartwatches and iPhones and this AI-backed service I’ll also indulge in personalised wellness plans.

These updates are believed to come in with the Apple Watch and some soon after its release. With that also the iOS 17 is coming and hopefully the Watches will be compatible with the upcoming operating system. But earlier there was a hint about blood pressure monitoring on Apple devices; but apparently it has come to a pause and is predicted to arrive by 2025.

Wistron; Apple's assembly partner for the iPhone SE; is allegedly preparing to wind down most of its operations in India; with the company rumored to withdraw most of itself from the country over the next year.

As an Apple supplier; Wistron has been working within India for over 15 years; but that is apparently soon to change. Rather than continue to build out business in India like Foxconn is doing; the Taiwanese firm is said to be moving out.

According to sources cited by Hindu BusinessLine; Wistron will be mostly withdrawing from India; and will probably approach the National Company Law Tribunal and the Registrar of Companies to dissolve its operations within a year.

The effort has already seemingly started; with Tata Electronics seeking to take control of Wistron's Karnataka iPhone production facility; which is also Wistron's main operation in India.

The factory became a problem for Wistron in December 2020; after employees rioted over allegations of shorted pay. The incident led to Apple putting Wistron on probation.

Sources claim that once the takeover of the iPhone arm is complete; Wistron will start the process of winding down.

It is also said that Wistron will also wait for more subsidy payments from the Mobile PLI scheme set up by the government to encourage production; before shutting down.

While Wistron employs over 12;000 people in India; not all will lose their jobs over time. The majority of Wistron's employees work under the iPhone unit that Tata is in the process of acquiring.

Wistron's other interests in the country include firms in the Internet of Things market; as well as attempts to attract more notebook production and work in the electric vehicle space. However; it now seems that these won't necessarily come to fruition; at least not in India.

There will still be some elements of Wistron active in India despite the winding-down situation. Sources say the only operations that will probably still exist in India will be its services business; set up to repair and maintain Apple products.",appleinsider.com,0.016096408,0.7657845,0.21811913,Malcolm Owen,[],False,,0

The story so far

Way back in 2013; Apple reportedly contacted medical tech company Masimo; as it was interested in forming a “working relationship” with the company. Following meetings in which details of Masimo’s pulse oximeter technology was discussed; Apple is said to have begun poaching the company’s staff.

One 2013 hire; confirmed at the beginning of 2014; was Masimo’s chief medical officer; Dr. Michael O’Reilly.

In 2020; Masimo filed a lawsuit officially accusing Apple of stealing trade secrets; and infringing ten of the company’s patents; in the O2 sensor in the Apple Watch.

The dispute between the two companies escalated later the same year; when the Apple Watch Series 6 launched with a new blood oxygen detection feature. Masimo asked the US International Trade Commission to ban imports of the new model.

That attempt failed; but earlier this year a court ruled that Apple had indeed infringed one of the ten patents. The Cupertino company is trying to have the decision overturned; with a final ruling expected next month. Apple also hit back; accusing Masimo of making an Apple Watch clone.

A report last month claimed that Apple paid Masimo’s chief medical officer millions of dollars in stock to poach him.

Of the ten infringement claims made by Masimo; Apple says that the judge rejected five of them; leaving the jury to decide on the remaining five.

Bloomberg reports that while six of the seven jurors found that Apple had not infringed any of Masimo’s patents; the remaining juror disagreed. The jury eventually concluded that it would not be possible to reach a unanimous verdict; and sent a note to the judge informing him of this.

Masimo said that it was disappointed by the result; and – despite Apple coming close to winning – the company intends to file for a retrial.

Apple said it was pleased by the partial win.

Masimo revealed that Apple had at one point planned to acquire the company; but CEO Tim Cook decided against this. Apple; for its part; put forward “numerous employees who had worked on the sensor project” to testify that they had not used Masimo’s tech in the development of the O2 sensor in the Apple Watch.

Whether Masimo will actually file for a retrial remains to be seen. Having come so close to losing the case; it would seem a risky thing to do.

The health tech company does still hold out hope that the US International Trade Commission might ban imports of the Apple Watch; based on its separate finding that Apple did infringe one patent; with a final decision to be made later this month. That decision was likely to be influenced by the result of this case – which we now don’t (officially) have.

Normally; we wouldn’t know anything more than the fact that the jury was unable to reach agreement. It’s unusual for a jury to reveal the split in its view; but the fact that it did so means that the ITC may still be swayed. My money says that Masimo will not be granted an import ban.",wiredfocus.com,0.02442539,0.85850585,0.1170688,wiredfocus,[],True,,0

The company is also looking for Principal Systems Architect; Principal Design Engineer; Principal Physical Design Verification Engineer; and Principal Integrity CAD Manager at Silicon Power. The offers suggest that Microsoft is looking to develop its own processors and compete against Apple in the upcoming software. Rumors point to a release next year; which would mean that Windows 11 has been one of the company’s shortest operating systems.,More and more companies see ARM processors as interesting for their products. It's not just Apple; Amazon for their AWS servers; and Google; they already have,"We have to know; before continuing; that there are big differences between ARM processors and Intel and AMD . The most prominent is that ARM is based on RISC; a reduced instruction set. Intel and AMD are based on CISC; which is a more complex instruction system.

We know Microsoft ’s intentions to several recently published job offers. They seem to want to create ARM processors specific to Windows 12 . This would be twofold: developing solutions for your operating system and optimize it on the other hand; to run on any system with ARM architecture chips.

More and more companies see ARM processors as interesting for their products. It’s not just Apple ; Amazon for their AWS servers; and Google ; they already have ARM-based systems. Something that should worry Intel ; but in a great move; it seems that the company will in the future manufacture the chips that; so far; ARM only licenses.

Microsoft would be looking for Principal Systems Architect at Chip Silicon; Principal Design Engineer; Principal Physical Design Verification Engineer; and Principal Integrity CAD Manager at Silicon Power. They want to create their own processors and we suppose that improving the windows 12 compatibility.

Within the offers you can read that these workers will be at the “forefront of computing.” It is also indicated that they will work “with various multifunctional groups to offer an innovative and high-performance silicon SoC.” Apparently; they would be interested in competing against Apple.

We imagine that behind this is the development of new Surface systems; mostly. These devices have not yet taken off and the company would like to promote them. They currently use Intel processors; but would like to ditch those in favor of their own chips.

One of the aspects that they would be working on for these chips would be to implement AI hardware. Note that Windows 12 will be an operating system very focused on this technology; where it will have a lot of weight. And it is that Microsoft is one of the main OpenAI shareholders.

There is little information at the moment that we know about the company’s new software. Rumors point to a release next year; something that would mean that Windows 11 has been one of the company’s shortest operating systems.

At the moment; Windows 10 is already seen for sentencing. The company has already said that they will only add minor improvements; optimizations; and security patches. The bulk of the development to be centered on Windows 11 and its next operating system.

With what we are seeing; W11 would be very similar to Windows 8; a bridge operating system. But all this is speculation; since we don’t have many reliable data. The company tries not to leak anything or the minimum.",gearrice.com,0.12435416,0.016713832,0.85893196,Jayden Ditchy,[],False,,0

You can’t just shake the screen or move your mouse from here to there; that just won’t work. You have to wait for each piece of junk to move to your intended direction.

One of the many benefits to using Craigslist to find cheap car accessories is the search function. You don’t have to spend hours sifting through a honda of lubbock to find what you need. Instead; you sit at home on your computer and perform a search. To find the best deals and what you need; search with targeted phrases. Search with the make; model; or part you need. For example; Honda Civic fenders; Mercedes hubcaps; Geo Tracker door; Dodge Ram tailgate; and so forth.

You may need auto parts for many reasons but the most common reason is from an auto accident. This is a real reason for a change of them and you may notice that these are more expensive in the beginning. The other real reason that you may need them is failing while they are in use. You may not know that it is even bad until it just stops working completely.

Having said this; certain postures are quite useful for height growth. These should be added in one’s fitness routine – chakrasana; halasana; sarvangasana; pashchimatanasana; pavanmuktasana; hastapadasana; mayurasana. Among Pranayams; the only pranayams I have found to be truly effective are Bahya Pranayam; Abhyantara and Chaturtha Pranayama. These provide all the benefits that are claimed from variety of breathing practices like Anulom Vilom; Bhastrika etc. These pranayams with rigorous cardio in open air gives all the benefit you desire from a fitness regime.

Note how I said shopping but not buying. I would use and abuse the internet to find out as much competitive information on the particular part you are looking for. Then before buying the research for the best deal. And don’t forget to include the shipping cost into your budget.

Eliminate toxic substances. Many times toxins are left in the garage- old paint; harsh cleaners; bug repellents; old garden/lawn sprays and fertilizers; etc. Take one afternoon to gather all the old toxins and research how to recycle them properly. Try looking on recycling resource websites your local city or village website.

Now I’m afraid they are starting to feel the affects of what was done to them. They are not receiving their payments. They don’t have a lot of inventory to choose from now. And they don’t have any used cars to sell as there are over 750;000 of those used cars either in the scrap yard or on their way there.

I took away $1;327 in profit (this is not counting the other scrap I’d already bought from him) for spending no more than twenty minutes in his office earning his trust. He was VERY happy getting a few thousand $$$ for a jar of DIRT sitting on a shelf.

After about two and a half weeks; dealers started dropping out of the program trying to cut their losses. Here they were with a lot of paper worth millions in some cases and all they had was “hope and promises”. Sound familiar?

You have to let it go. Believe me I know it is difficult. I had a horrendous crime committed against my family. I cannot describe the feelings I had. It affected my whole life; everything.",xpendx.com,0.041308593,0.041187752,0.9175036,mohammedfitzroy,[],False,,0

For its first quarter of fiscal 2023; Apple's revenue fell 5% year over year to $117.2 billion; due to a challenging environment due to inflation; the war in Ukraine; and lingering impacts from the pandemic. Analysts are in agreement with Apple's guidance; with their expectations for the direction of its revenue falling 4.6%. Finally; Apple typically uses its fiscal Q2 update to authorize more capital for share repurchases and to announce a dividend increase.,The tech company is expected to report another year-over-year decline in revenue.,"This week will be packed with earnings reports from tech companies. But the most high-profile report will be Apple's (AAPL -0.05%). The tech giant reports earnings on Thursday. Given its nearly $2.7 trillion market capitalization; its report could have a big influence on the overall market.

Ahead of the iPhone maker's fiscal second-quarter earnings report; here's an overview of its recent performance and some key items to check on after the update goes live.

For its first quarter of fiscal 2023; Apple's revenue fell 5% year over year to $117.2 billion. Apple CEO Tim Cook said in the company's earnings call for the period that the decline was ""a result of the challenging environment ...""

What; exactly; did this challenging environment consist of? One of the main contributors was a huge foreign exchange impact. Foreign exchange rate headwinds negatively impacted the company's year-over-year growth rate by about 800 basis points. Indeed; Apple would have reported year-over-year growth in most of its markets if it excluded this headwind; Cook explained during the call. Sales were also held back by supply chain challenges; which led to production of its new iPhones being substantially lower than planned during the quarter. Finally; management cited ""a challenging macroeconomic environment"" due to inflation; the war in Ukraine; and lingering impacts from the pandemic.

Given the continued uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment; management said it expected a similar year-over-year growth rate in its revenue in fiscal Q2.

Analysts; for the most part; seem to be in agreement with Apple's guidance. On average; they expect the tech company's fiscal Q2 revenue to fall 4.6% year over year -- a growth rate that's not too far from what Apple reported in fiscal Q1. The consensus forecast for Apple's earnings per share is $1.43 -- a 6% year-over-year decline. This year-over-year change would be an improvement from the 10.5% decline in earnings per share Apple saw in fiscal Q1.

One number that could really move the stock when Apple reports is management's revenue outlook. The current analyst estimate calls for fiscal Q3 revenue of $84.3 billion. Importantly; this would mark a return to year-over-year growth for the company. While Apple has been avoiding providing a specific guidance figure during its earnings reports recently; it has been providing some commentary about its expectations for the direction of its revenue. During Apple's fiscal Q2 earnings call; look for the company to say it expects its revenue to return to growth in fiscal Q3.

Finally; Apple typically uses its fiscal Q2 update to authorize more capital for share repurchases and to announce a dividend increase. Last year; Apple boosted its dividend by 5% and authorized an additional $90 billion for share repurchases. Shareholders are likely hoping Apple announces another significant increase to its share-repurchase authorization and another dividend increase.

The tech giant is scheduled to report its fiscal Q2 results after market close on Thursday; May 4. Investors will be able to find the earnings release on Apple's investor relations website.",fool.com,0.01036754,0.9704329,0.019199625,Daniel Sparks,[],False,,0

The company managed to amass nearly $400 million in deposits on the first day of the launch alone; the report said. Customers opened about 240;000 accounts during the launch week; it added.

Apple's massive iPhone user base and the attractive returns are the two pulling plants; drawing hoards of depositors; the report said.

The 4.15% return Apple offers on the savings account it floated along with Goldman Sachs Group; Inc. GS is more than the 3.90% return Goldman offers for its in-house high-yielding savings account under the Marcus consumer brand.

Why It's Important: The strong deposit mobilization comes at a time well-established regional banking giants are seeing their deposits wiped out. Just Monday; San Francisco-based First Republic went under after its first-quarter earnings report showed a more than 35% tumble in deposits amid bank runs.

JPMorgan Chase & Co.‘s JPM deposit rates are around 0.01% and if the financial services giant were to pay a 4% rate on its $2.3 trillion in deposits; it may have to shell out $90 billion per year; a tweet by right-leaning blogsite Zerohedge showed.

There has been a flight of deposits to CD; money market funds and fintechs like Apple; said Richard Crone; CEO of payments firm Crone.

Commenting on Apple's move; Peter Mallouk; CEO of Creative Planning said recently ""The brilliance of Apple has been about taking the complicated and making it look easy.”

He sees Apple doing the same with its savings account. The account could be a much easier option for customers to invest their money in rather than Treasury bills; certificates of deposits; or money market funds.

“This is gonna be a grand slam; and a ton of people are gonna sign up for their card and it's gonna be another huge profit center for them;” he added.

In premarket trading; Apple shares edged up 0.01% to $169.61; according to Benzinga Pro data.

Apple and Google are partnering to make it harder for tracking beacons like AirTag to be used for stalking; by proposing a standard to prevent misuse.

While intended to keep track of lost items; products like AirTag have also been used for malicious purposes; such as stalking. Apple and Google want to change that by working together on a new standard for the product category.

Announced on Tuesday; the two tech giants jointly submitted a proposed industry specification that would allow Bluetooth location tracking devices to be compatible with unauthorized tracking detection systems and alerts across both iOS and Android.

Other companies have also expressed support for the initiative; including Samsung; Tile; Chipolo; eufy Security; and Pebblebee.

""Apple launched AirTag to give users the peace of mind knowing where to find their most important items;"" said Ron Huang; Apple's vice president of Sensing and Connectivity. ""We built AirTag and the Find My network with a set of proactive features to discourage unwanted tracking — a first in the industry — and we continue to make improvements to help ensure the technology is being used as intended.""

Huang continues ""This new industry specification builds upon the AirTag protections; and through collaboration with Google results in a critical step forward to help combat unwanted tracking across iOS and Android.""

Researchers at Mount Sinai have shown that data from wearable devices like the Apple Watch; analyzed through machine learning; can accurately assess a person’s mental resilience and well-being. This study suggests a future where psychological states can be remotely monitored without mental health questionnaires; potentially enhancing access to mental health services. Applying machine learning models; a type of artificial intelligence (AI); to data collected passively from wearable devices can identify a patient’s degree of resilience and well-being; according to investigators at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. The findings; reported in the May 2nd issue of JAMIA Open; support wearable devices; such as the Apple Watch®; as a way to monitor and assess psychological states remotely without requiring the completion of mental health questionnaires. The paper points out that resilience; or an individual’s ability to overcome difficulty; is an important stress mitigator; reduces morbidity; and improves chronic disease management. “Wearables provide a means to continually collect information about an individual’s physical state. Our results provide insight into the feasibility of assessing psychological characteristics from this passively collected data;” said first author Robert P. Hirten; MD; Clinical Director; Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai. “To our knowledge; this is the first study to evaluate whether resilience; a key mental health feature; can be evaluated from devices such as the Apple Watch.” Mental health disorders are common; accounting for 13 percent of the burden of global disease; with a quarter of the population at some point experiencing psychological illness. Yet we have limited resources for their evaluation; say the researchers. “There are wide disparities in access across geography and socioeconomic status; and the need for in-person assessment or the completion of validated mental health surveys is further limiting;” said senior author Zahi Fayad; PhD; Director of the BioMedical Engineering and Imaging Institute at Icahn Mount Sinai. “A better understanding of who is at psychological risk and an improved means of tracking the impact of psychological interventions is needed. The growth of digital technology presents an opportunity to improve access to mental health services for all people.” To determine if machine learning models could be trained to distinguish an individual’s degree of resilience and psychological well-being using the data from wearable devices; the Icahn Mount Sinai researchers analyzed data from the Warrior Watch Study. Leveraged for the current digital observational study; the data set comprised 329 healthcare workers enrolled at seven hospitals in New York City. Subjects wore an Apple Watch® Series 4 or 5 for the duration of their participation; measuring heart rate variability and resting heart rate throughout the follow-up period. Surveys were collected measuring resilience; optimism; and emotional support at baseline. The metrics collected were found to be predictive in identifying resilience or well-being states. Despite the Warrior Watch Study not being designed to evaluate this endpoint; the findings support the further assessment of psychological characteristics from passively collected wearable data. “We hope that this approach will enable us to bring psychological assessment and care to a larger population; who may not have access at this time;” said Micol Zweig; MPH; co-author of the paper and Associate Director of Clinical Research; Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai. “We also intend to evaluate this technique in other patient populations to further refine the algorithm and improve its applicability.” To that end; the research team plans to continue using wearable data to observe a range of physical and psychological disorders and diseases. The simultaneous development of sophisticated analytical tools; including artificial intelligence; say the investigators; can facilitate the analysis of data collected from these devices and apps to identify patterns associated with a given mental or physical disease condition.

Wearable devices may be a means to monitor psychological states through effortless data collection using artificial intelligence. Researchers at Mount Sinai have shown that data from wearable devices like the Apple Watch; analyzed through machine learning; can accurately assess a person’s mental resilience and well-being. This study suggests a future where psychological states can be remotely monitored without mental health questionnaires; potentially enhancing access to mental health services. Applying machine learning models; a type of artificial intelligence (AI); to data collected passively from wearable devices can identify a patient’s degree of resilience and well-being; according to investigators at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. The findings; reported in the May 2nd issue of JAMIA Open; support wearable devices; such as the Apple Watch®; as a way to monitor and assess psychological states remotely without requiring the completion of mental health questionnaires. The paper points out that resilience; or an individual’s ability to overcome difficulty; is an important stress mitigator; reduces morbidity; and improves chronic disease management. “Wearables provide a means to continually collect information about an individual’s physical state. Our results provide insight into the feasibility of assessing psychological characteristics from this passively collected data;” said first author Robert P. Hirten; MD; Clinical Director; Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai. “To our knowledge; this is the first study to evaluate whether resilience; a key mental health feature; can be evaluated from devices such as the Apple Watch.” Mental health disorders are common; accounting for 13 percent of the burden of global disease; with a quarter of the population at some point experiencing psychological illness. Yet we have limited resources for their evaluation; say the researchers. “There are wide disparities in access across geography and socioeconomic status; and the need for in-person assessment or the completion of validated mental health surveys is further limiting;” said senior author Zahi Fayad; PhD; Director of the BioMedical Engineering and Imaging Institute at Icahn Mount Sinai. “A better understanding of who is at psychological risk and an improved means of tracking the impact of psychological interventions is needed.

The two companies behind the iPhone and the software that powers Android phones on Tuesday submitted a proposal to set standards for combatting secret surveillance on Apple’s AirTag trackers and similar gadgets. The concept also has the backing of Samsung; which sells the most Android smartphones worldwide; as well as tracking products similar to the AirTag such as Tile; Chipolo; and Pebblebee.

The $30 AirTag has become a popular item since its 2021 release; helping users pinpoint the locations of a wide variety of lost property. But stalkers have also deployed AirTags and similar products to shadow former love interests and other people who don’t realize they are being tracked.

Apple and AirTag hope to have a plan in place by the end of this year to thwart stealth tracking. The solution would be distributed through software updates to iPhones and Android phones.

Erica Olsen; the senior director of National Network to End Domestic Violence’s Safety Net Project; applauded the effort to set an industry standard that she believes will help protect survivors of abusive relationships and other people that have been targets of stealth technology. “These new standards will minimize opportunities for abuse of this technology and decrease the burden on survivors in detecting unwanted trackers;” Olsen said.",thebusinessjournal.com,0.2825232,0.020951249,0.6965255,Ben Hensley,"[{'country': 'us', 'state': 'CA', 'city': 'Fresno'}]",True,CA,0

The proposal for an industry standard across the Android and iOS mobile platforms will also be supported by other relevant manufacturers such as Samsung; Tile; Chipolo; eufy Security and Pebblebee; the companies announced on Tuesday. In recent months; there have been repeated reports of incidents in which Apple’s AirTags or other Bluetooth trackers have been used to track people against their will.

Apple introduced some security measures to prevent stalking by AirTags. For example; foreign AirTags that are in the vicinity of another person for a while will emit a warning tone. In addition; the potential victims of persecution receive instructions on the iPhone on how to deactivate the foreign AirTag in their vicinity. However; this anti-stalking protection only works if everyone involved is using an iPhone. That should change now.

Oh; wait; you can’t: “You are no longer connected to the internet;” it sneers.

Apple’s new Rapid Security Response update is a mess. With broken apps and bogus error messages; the whole thing seems a bit half-baked.

No doubt it’s important to install. But; in today’s SB Blogwatch; we’re in the dark—because there aren’t any release notes.

Your humble blogwatcher curated these bloggy bits for your entertainment. Not to mention: Hidden patterns inside cheese.

RSR RSI — but Keep Trying

“ ”

A Rapid Security Response update is a special kind of update that doesn’t require users to perform a normal software update. Instead of a lengthy update procedure; the update can instead be quickly downloaded and installed within minutes. … This can include fast fixes for urgent security issues; such as actively used exploits … to mitigate risks of infection or data loss.

…

So far … every attempt to update has been met with a warning that the device cannot verify the security response [and] that the device is “no longer connected to the internet” (when that isn’t the case). This may be a case of server load; but the download is very small.

…

When an RSR is applied; the update adds a letter to the end of the version number; for example turning iOS 16.4.1 to iOS 16.4.1 (a). … RSR installation can be disabled; with the content of the RSR rolled into the next standard software update.





“ ”

Initially; a good many iPhone users were unable to install the update. They got an error message that said that the device was ‘unable to verify security response’ because it was not connected to the internet; even though that wasn’t the case.

…

The rollout is staggered. … So if you still haven’t received it or are still having trouble installing it; the issue will likely be resolved in the next 48 hours.





Not very rapid if they take just as a long as a regular software update—lol.





However; dhinakg disputes the theory it’s because of a staggered rollout:

This error is not related to ramping. Ramping (aka phased rollouts) is basically when automatic update notification is delayed on a schedule.

…

There’s an error with Apple’s update signing server (TSS). … This is likely a screwup for the first public RSR and should be fixed in a few hours; just give it a bit. Guess Apple should’ve provided a more specific string for Tatsu rejection than just using the generic “no longer connected to the internet.”





Got yours yet? John Gruber notes another faux pas:

“ ”

I’ve seen a few of these RSR updates while running beta versions of iOS; but I suspect those were all just tests from Apple of the RSR delivery and update mechanisms. It’s a great new mechanism for Apple; but one that they’d only use for truly significant bugs — ones they realize are being actively exploited in the wild; or could be to deeply detrimental effect.

…

[But it] seems a little weird that today’s RSR updates aren’t listed yet on Apple’s security updates page. In recent years Apple has been very diligent about updating this page. … These new RSR updates seem to exist outside this documentation system for now.





Is there a downside? Yes; if you’re in the middle of something; as niij nudges:

Warning: If you install this it doesn’t give you the option to delay a reboot to apply the update. I got a notification my computer would be restarting in 60 seconds as soon as the install completed.





A rushed Apple update years ago [bricked] all of the machines that installed it in the initial hours before the problem was discovered. The employee responsible is probably managing a Cinnabon location in Ohama today under Witness Protection.





Aaaand there it is. Here’s Num Lock:

Since installing this; HomeKit thinks I’m not home and I can’t seem to fix it. I’m about three motion alerts away from uninstalling it.





It would appear that this “Rapid Security Response” was released a bit too rapidly.

“Today; Apple and Google jointly submitted a proposed industry specification to help combat the misuse of Bluetooth location-tracking devices for unwanted tracking;” the Apple announcement explains. “The first-of-its-kind specification will allow Bluetooth location-tracking devices to be compatible with unauthorized tracking detection and alerts across iOS and Android platforms. Samsung; Tile; Chipolo; eufy Security; and Pebblebee have expressed support for the draft specification; which offers best practices and instructions for manufacturers; should they choose to build these capabilities into their products.”

This specification is based on work that came out of Apple’s horrible experience with AirTag stalking; where the Tile-like devices have been used by bad actors to illegally track their victims. And with Google planning a similar product line; it’s perhaps not surprising that the owner of the other dominant mobile platform has joined forces with Apple.

“Bluetooth trackers have created tremendous user benefits; but they also bring the potential of unwanted tracking; which requires industrywide action to solve;” Google vice president Dave Burke says. “Android has an unwavering commitment to protecting users; and will continue to develop strong safeguards and collaborate with the industry to help combat the misuse of Bluetooth tracking devices.”

The companies released a draft version of the Detecting Unwanted Location Trackers specification through the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF); and they are asking interested parties to comment on and contribute to it over the next three months. After that; Apple and Google will together address the feedback; and then they will release a production implementation of the specification for unwanted tracking alerts by the end of 2023.

It is intended to make it possible for iOS and Android smartphones to detect unauthorized Bluetooth tracking devices to protect individuals against unwanted surveillance.

The two companies say they have been working on a new industry specification to help prevent Bluetooth location-tracking devices being used to track people without permission. They also seem to have the industry behind them; as Samsung; Tile; Chipolo; eufy Security; and Pebblebee have all expressed support for the draft specification; which has been filed with the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

The idea is to make it possible for iOS and Android smartphones to detect unauthorized Bluetooth tracking devices to protect individuals against unwanted surveillance. In addition to incorporating feedback from device manufacturers; input from various safety and advocacy groups has been integrated into the development of the specification.

Erica Olsen; senior director of the National Network to End Domestic Violence’s Safety Net Project said in a statement: “These new standards will minimize opportunities for abuse of this technology and decrease the burden on survivors in detecting unwanted trackers.”

In the same statement; Alexandra Reeve Givens; the Center for Democracy & Technology’s president and CEO; explained that one of the keys to protecting against this kind of abuse is; “a universal; OS-level solution that is able to detect trackers made by different companies on the variety of smartphones that people use every day.”

What problem does this solve?

Ever since Apple introduced AirTags the ether has been populated by horrific tales of various unpleasant uses of the tracking devices. While these devices are great because they link to Apple’s FindMy network and make it really easy to locate lost or stolen devices (NYPD recently gave away 500 of them to help protect against car crime); some have abused them to track people in malicious ways.

These have ranged from car thieves tracking vehicles they intend to steal to abusive partners monitoring their victims. Apple has responded in several ways; including better warnings for iPhone users in the event they have an unknown tag moving with them. That system will alert you if a tag is found. But none of these protections are completely foolproof; and some are platform specific — the warnings an iPhone user sees are not shared with Android; for example.

That’s part of what the specification tries to solve. It will allow Bluetooth location-tracking devices to be compatible with unauthorized tracking detection and alerts across iOS and Android platforms. The draft specification also offers best practices and instructions for manufacturers; should they choose to build these capabilities into their products.

It means that you’ll be able to use AirTags and other Bluetooth tracking devices to track your items; not to track people.

What Apple and Google said

“Apple launched AirTag to give users the peace of mind knowing where to find their most important items;” said Ron Huang; Apple’s vice president of sensing and connectivity. “We built AirTag and the Find My network with a set of proactive features to discourage unwanted tracking — a first in the industry — and we continue to make improvements to help ensure the technology is being used as intended.

“This new industry specification builds upon the AirTag protections; and through collaboration with Google results in a critical step forward to help combat unwanted tracking across iOS and Android;” Huang said.

“Bluetooth trackers have created tremendous user benefits; but they also bring the potential of unwanted tracking; which requires industry-wide action to solve;” said Dave Burke; Google’s vice president of engineering for Android. “Android has an unwavering commitment to protecting users; and will continue to develop strong safeguards and collaborate with the industry to help combat the misuse of Bluetooth tracking devices.”

Of course; part of the reason Apple; Google and the industry have agreed to work together is because they recognize that until individual privacy is protected few are likely to adopt these technologies. But manufacturers of connected devices want to nurture this adoption as they attempt to add features to their products.

What happens next?

The specification process works like this; nowthat the draft has been submitted to the IETF.
• For the next three months; interested parties can review and comment on the proposals.
• Apple and Google will then resolve any problems raised during the review.
• They will then introduce what’s called a production implementation of the specification by the end of 2023.
• The two companies will then support that specification in future versions of iOS and Android.

It isn’t yet clear whether we can anticipate the specification being finalized and shipping as an OS update to supported platforms by the end of this year or in 2024; though if the standardizing process works well; perhaps it’s not too long before another stalking nightmare is terminated.

Apple; through its AirTag and other Find My network accessories; already offers warnings over unwanted tracking. But that feature isn’t open to tracking devices that operate on other networks. The proposed requirements and recommendations would extend the capabilities of alerting individuals of nearby tracking devices across the industry.

Companies with similar tracking devices; including Samsung; Tile; Chipolo; Eufy Security and Pebblebee; “have expressed support for the draft specification;” according to a statement.

The collaboration marks the latest effort to address privacy and safety concerns posed by devices such as the AirTag; Apple’s lightweight Bluetooth tracking device intended to help keep tabs on luggage; wallets or keys. Police departments in New York and Iowa; for example; have received reports of AirTags placed on the vehicles of unsuspecting owners.

Apple said in 2022 it was aware of “bad actors attempting to misuse AirTag for malicious or criminal purposes.” The company said at the time a software update would make alerts more clear about when an AirTag was following someone.

Since the release of the new AirTags in 2021; Apple has gone ahead and implemented a couple of new anti-stalking features. This new message informs folks that using this item to track people is indeed a criminal offense in most places around the world.,Apple and Google want to put a stop to the misuse of Bluetooth gadgets like AirTags and Tile trackers.,"Apple and Google are teaming up to fight AirTag and Tile bluetooth tracker stalking by proposing an industry specification. This specification is intended to “alert users in the event of suspected unwanted tracking;” according to the official press release. Location-tracking devices can be a godsend; especially when you misplace your keys or wallet. However; they can be used for far more nefarious reasons like stalking and car theft. However; this proposed specification is meant to squash the misuse of these tracking devices.

So; how will this standard work? Well; it would allow Bluetooth-enabled gadgets to be compatible with unauthorized tracking detection and alerts across both iOS and Android ecosystems. They’ve already got the support of Tile; Samsung; Eufy Security; Pebblebee; Chipolo; and more. Apple and Google submitted this proposed specification to the Internet Engineering Task Force (otherwise known as IETF); which is a standards organization that was established back in 1986. Interested parties are currently being invited to review and comment on the proposal over a period of three months. Once they’ve gone over the feedback; they’ll release a production implement of the specification; which is expected by the end of 2023.

Since the release of the new AirTags in 2021; Apple has gone ahead and implemented a couple of new anti-stalking features. The device will now producer louder alert sounds when separated from from its owner. You’ll also see a warning message when setting up the AirTag for the first time. This new message informs folks that using this item to track people is indeed a criminal offense in most places around the world. While these changes are no doubt important; Google and Apple seem to be taking things a step further.

It is intended to make it possible for iOS and Android smartphones to detect unauthorized Bluetooth tracking devices to protect individuals against unwanted surveillance. Apple has responded in several ways; including better warnings for iPhone users in the event they have an unknown tag moving with them; but none of these protections are completely foolproof. The specification also offers best practices and instructions for manufacturers; should they choose to build these capabilities into their products.,The days when people can be abusively tracked using devices such as Apple’s AirTags may be numbered; both Apple and Google today jointly announced work on a new standard that will prevent thi…,"The days when people can be abusively tracked using devices such as Apple’s AirTags may be numbered; both Apple and Google today jointly announced work on a new standard that will prevent this from happening and hinted that Android users will soon be able to tell whether they’re being tracked by an AirTag.

The two companies say they have been working on a new industry specification to help prevent Bluetooth location-tracking devices being used to track people without permission. They also seem to have the industry behind them; as Samsung; Tile; Chipolo; eufy Security; and Pebblebee have all expressed support for the draft specification; which has been filed with the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

The idea is to make it possible for iOS and Android smartphones to detect unauthorized Bluetooth tracking devices to protect individuals against unwanted surveillance. In addition to incorporating feedback from device manufacturers; input from various safety and advocacy groups has been integrated into the development of the specification.

Erica Olsen; senior director of the National Network to End Domestic Violence’s Safety Net Project said in a statement: “These new standards will minimize opportunities for abuse of this technology and decrease the burden on survivors in detecting unwanted trackers.”

In the same statement; Alexandra Reeve Givens; the Center for Democracy & Technology’s president and CEO; explained that one of the keys to protecting against this kind of abuse is; “a universal; OS-level solution that is able to detect trackers made by different companies on the variety of smartphones that people use every day.”

What problem does this solve?

Ever since Apple introduced AirTags the ether has been populated by horrific tales of various unpleasant uses of the tracking devices. While these devices are great because they link to Apple’s FindMy network and make it really easy to locate lost or stolen devices (NYPD recently gave away 500 of them to help protect against car crime); some have abused them to track people in malicious ways.

These have ranged from car thieves tracking vehicles they intend to steal to abusive partners monitoring their victims. Apple has responded in several ways; including better warnings for iPhone users in the event they have an unknown tag moving with them. That system will alert you if a tag is found. But none of these protections are completely foolproof; and some are platform specific — the warnings an iPhone user sees are not shared with Android; for example.

That’s part of what the specification tries to solve. It will allow Bluetooth location-tracking devices to be compatible with unauthorized tracking detection and alerts across iOS and Android platforms. The draft specification also offers best practices and instructions for manufacturers; should they choose to build these capabilities into their products.

It means that you’ll be able to use AirTags and other Bluetooth tracking devices to track your items; not to track people.

What Apple and Google said

“Apple launched AirTag to give users the peace of mind knowing where to find their most important items;” said Ron Huang; Apple’s vice president of sensing and connectivity. “We built AirTag and the Find My network with a set of proactive features to discourage unwanted tracking — a first in the industry — and we continue to make improvements to help ensure the technology is being used as intended.

“This new industry specification builds upon the AirTag protections; and through collaboration with Google results in a critical step forward to help combat unwanted tracking across iOS and Android;” Huang said.

“Bluetooth trackers have created tremendous user benefits; but they also bring the potential of unwanted tracking; which requires industry-wide action to solve;” said Dave Burke; Google’s vice president of engineering for Android. “Android has an unwavering commitment to protecting users; and will continue to develop strong safeguards and collaborate with the industry to help combat the misuse of Bluetooth tracking devices.”

Of course; part of the reason Apple; Google and the industry have agreed to work together is because they recognize that until individual privacy is protected few are likely to adopt these technologies. But manufacturers of connected devices want to nurture this adoption as they attempt to add features to their products.

What happens next?

The specification process works like this; nowthat the draft has been submitted to the IETF.
• For the next three months; interested parties can review and comment on the proposals.
• Apple and Google will then resolve any problems raised during the review.
• They will then introduce what’s called a production implementation of the specification by the end of 2023.
• The two companies will then support that specification in future versions of iOS and Android.

It isn’t yet clear whether we can anticipate the specification being finalized and shipping as an OS update to supported platforms by the end of this year or in 2024; though if the standardizing process works well; perhaps it’s not too long before another stalking nightmare is terminated.

It also has a Savings account offering a 4.15% APY and 3% Daily Cash back at Apple and at select merchant partners when you use Apple Pay. It is a good choice if you like Apple products and you want to keep your finances as simple as possible; but it does fall short of the top credit cards in a few areas.,The [creditcard slug=apple-card field=offer_name] earns cash back and can be paired with an Apple Savings account.

But our editorial integrity ensures our experts’ opinions aren’t influenced by compensation. Terms may apply to offers listed on this page.

Apple often does a fantastic job of marketing its products. Who doesn't remember those mid-2000s iPod commercials? The Apple Card is no exception. The tech giant claims to have ""completely reinvented the credit card;"" and it had 6.7 million cardholders as of 2022.

The Apple Card is a rewards card available exclusively to iPhone users that earns Daily Cash; which is cash back you receive the same day you make a purchase. Last month; Apple added another big perk for cardholders with its Savings account; a high-yield savings account offering a 4.15% APY.

However; it's a crowded credit card marketplace with a lot of great options available. If you're thinking about signing up for this Apple credit card; you should know what it offers and how it stacks up to the competition.

The Apple Card has several cool features that make it stand out from other cards. For one; there are no fees. That means no annual fee; no late fees; and no foreign transaction fees.

The only potential extra cost is interest. But when you're ready to make a payment; Apple Card shows you an estimate of how much interest you'll pay over time based on the payment amount you enter. That's helpful; as you get to see exactly how much credit card interest can cost you.

The most valuable perk of the Apple Card is Daily Cash. Most cash back credit cards send you your cash back once per month after the billing cycle closes. Apple does it every day. Here are the Apple Card's cash back rates:
• 3% Daily Cash back at Apple and at select merchant partners when you use Apple Pay (current partners include Uber; Walgreens; and T-Mobile)

What makes this Daily Cash even better is that you can now pair your Apple Card with a Savings account from Goldman Sachs. The account has no fees; no minimum deposits; and no minimum balance requirements. And its 4.15% APY is comparable to the best savings account rates.

Once you set up a Savings account; you can have your Daily Cash deposited into it automatically. This makes it easy and convenient to earn a high interest rate on your cash back.

Another perk of the Apple Card is that it lets you pay for new Apple products over time; interest-free. You can pay off purchases in monthly installments for six to 24 months; depending on the product.

Why the Apple Card isn't quite a slam dunk

The Apple Card doesn't have any glaring flaws; but it does fall short of the top credit cards in a few areas.

Its biggest drawback is that it doesn't have a sign-up bonus. Many rewards cards have sign-up bonuses you earn if you reach a spending minimum. For example; some cash back cards offer a $200 bonus to new cardholders who spend $500 in the first three months.

Depending on your spending habits; you may also be able to earn more back with a different card. The Apple Card is pretty limited in terms of bonus categories; earning 3% Daily Cash on purchases with Apple and its merchant partners. Other cash back cards earn 3% to as high as 6% in broader bonus categories; such as gas and groceries; dining; or entertainment.

Is the Apple Card worth it?

The Apple Card is a good choice if you like Apple products and you want to keep your finances as simple as possible.

If you use Apple Pay for most purchases; then you'll earn 2% Daily Cash on that spending; which is a competitive rate. And Apple takes practically all the work out of managing your credit card rewards since you can have your Daily Cash automatically transferred to a Savings account.

I'd recommend checking out other options before you apply for an Apple Card; though. You might find that there are cash back cards that better fit your spending habits. For example; if you spend a lot on groceries; one of the best grocery credit cards could offer more value. It's always worth comparing multiple cards before picking one to ensure you're making the right choice.",fool.com,0.059764553,0.018505158,0.9217302,Lyle Daly,[],False,,0

Since the launch of AirTags; privacy experts and law enforcement have said some people use it for criminal or malicious purposes.

AirTags are intended to be slipped into or attached to keys; wallets; backpacks and other items so people can find them when they are lost.

In an effort to boost privacy; Apple in 2021 had launched an Android detector app to help users scan nearby AirTags or other similar item trackers that might be traveling with them without their knowledge.

As reported today by Reuters; Apple is currently battling a $2 billion lawsuit in the United Kingdom over this decision; arguing that the case is “baseless.”

It’s seemingly the fight that Apple will never truly be able to end…

This lawsuit accuses Apple of “hiding defective batteries in millions of iPhones” by throttling the performance of those devices. This is a little bit different than some of the other Batterygate lawsuits we’ve seen over the years because of that accusation that the batteries were defective.

The lawsuit is valued at 1.6 billion pounds plus interest; which equates to around $2 billion. Reuters reports that the lawsuit is being led by “consumer champion Justin Gutmann on behalf of iPhone users in the United Kingdom.” Lawyers representing Gutmann argue that “concealed issues with batteries in certain phone models and ‘surreptitiously’ installed a power management tool which limited performance.”

In its written response; Apple argued that this lawsuit is “baseless” and said that most iPhone batteries were not defective. The company did; however; acknowledge that a “small number of iPhone 6s models” did have defective batteries; but those users were offered free battery replacements.

As for its decision to throttle performance based on battery health; Apple said that it “only reduced an iPhone 6’s performance by an average of 10%.”

Apple has faced lawsuits around the world over the Batterygate controversy. The company’s practice of throttling older iPhones based on performance was first discovered in 2017 by sleuthing users on Reddit and a subsequent 9to5Mac report. Apple agreed to pay $500 million to settle a United States lawsuit over the matter. It also agreed to pay $113 million to settle a separate multi-state investigation.

At the time; Apple was forced to issue a public apology; offer discounted battery replacements; and give users the choice of whether or not to enable the feature. Since then; the company has also rolled out new features to iOS designed to mitigate the long-term degradation of battery health.

It remains to be seen where this United Kingdom lawsuit will ultimately lead; but Apple seems keen to keep fighting it.",learndaily.thats.im,0.015359412,0.91295743,0.07168315,learn,[],True,,0

Location-tracking devices help users find personal items like their keys; purse; luggage; and more through crowdsourced finding networks. However; they can also be misused for unwanted tracking of individuals.

Today Apple and Google jointly submitted a proposed industry specification to help combat the misuse of Bluetooth location-tracking devices for unwanted tracking. The first-of-its-kind specification will allow Bluetooth location-tracking devices to be compatible with unauthorized tracking detection and alerts across iOS and Android platforms. Samsung; Tile; Chipolo; eufy Security; and Pebblebee have expressed support for the draft specification; which offers best practices and instructions for manufacturers; should they choose to build these capabilities into their products.

“Apple launched AirTag to give users the peace of mind knowing where to find their most important items;” said Ron Huang; Apple’s vice president of Sensing and Connectivity. “We built AirTag and the Find My network with a set of proactive features to discourage unwanted tracking — a first in the industry — and we continue to make improvements to help ensure the technology is being used as intended. This new industry specification builds upon the AirTag protections; and through collaboration with Google results in a critical step forward to help combat unwanted tracking across iOS and Android.”

“Bluetooth trackers have created tremendous user benefits; but they also bring the potential of unwanted tracking; which requires industrywide action to solve;” said Dave Burke; Google’s vice president of Engineering for Android. “Android has an unwavering commitment to protecting users; and will continue to develop strong safeguards and collaborate with the industry to help combat the misuse of Bluetooth tracking devices.”

In addition to incorporating feedback from device manufacturers; input from various safety and advocacy groups has been integrated into the development of the specification.

“The National Network to End Domestic Violence has been advocating for universal standards to protect survivors — and all people — from the misuse of Bluetooth tracking devices. This collaboration and the resulting standards are a significant step forward. NNEDV is encouraged by this progress;” said Erica Olsen; the National Network to End Domestic Violence’s senior director of its Safety Net Project. “These new standards will minimize opportunities for abuse of this technology and decrease the burden on survivors in detecting unwanted trackers. We are grateful for these efforts and look forward to continuing to work together to address unwanted tracking and misuse.”

“Today’s release of a draft specification is a welcome step to confront harmful misuses of Bluetooth location trackers;” said Alexandra Reeve Givens; the Center for Democracy & Technology’s president and CEO. “CDT continues to focus on ways to make these devices more detectable and reduce the likelihood that they will be used to track people. A key element to reducing misuse is a universal; OS-level solution that is able to detect trackers made by different companies on the variety of smartphones that people use every day. We commend Apple and Google for their partnership and dedication to developing a uniform solution to improve detectability. We look forward to the specification moving through the standardization process and to further engagement on ways to reduce the risk of Bluetooth location trackers being misused.”

MacDailyNews Note: The specification has been submitted as an Internet-Draft via the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF); a leading standards development organization. Interested parties are invited and encouraged to review and comment over the next three months. Following the comment period; Apple and Google will partner to address feedback; and will release a production implementation of the specification for unwanted tracking alerts by the end of 2023 that will then be supported in future versions of iOS and Android.

The tech giant is facing lawsuits worth up to $2 billion brought by head of consumer advocacy Justin Gutmann on behalf of iPhone users in the UK. Gutmann’s lawyers alleged in court documents that Apple had hidden battery problems in some phone models and secretly installed a power management tool that limited the smartphone’s performance.

Apple stated in writing that the lawsuit was “unfounded” and vehemently denies that its iPhone batteries were defective; except for a small number of iPhone 6s models for which it offered free battery replacements. The company also reports that a power management update introduced in 2017 to manage old batteries or weak batteries only slowed the iPhone 6’s performance by an average of 10%.

On Tuesday Gutmann appealed to the London Competition Court of Appeal to confirm the case and bring it to trial. His attorney; Philip Moser; cited Apple’s 2020 US Class Action Settlement Agreement and US state regulatory lawsuits over iPhone battery issues as evidence that Apple “didn’t say it never happenedIn 2019; Apple also pledged to be “more open” with iPhone users about battery health before the UK regulator; Moser said.

The company denies misleading its customers about iPhone battery issues; citing a public apology it issued in 2017 that offered affected customers cheaper battery replacements. Apple attorney David Wolfson said the lawsuit actually alleges that “Not all batteries can deliver the required peak performance under all circumstances and at all times‘; which is typical of all battery-powered devices.",technewsspace.com,0.020144213,0.8811584,0.09869744,,[],False,,0

Registered developers can download the beta through the Apple Developer Center and after the appropriate profile is installed; with the betas available through the Software Update mechanism in System Settings.

macOS 13.4 adds the simplified beta installation method that was first introduced in iOS 16.4. With the update; developers and public beta testers enrolled in Apple’s respective programs can toggle on beta updates from System Settings on the Mac; without the need to install a profile.

An Apple ID associated with either a public beta account or a developer account is required to turn on beta updates; which means that it is no longer possible to use a developer profile not associated with a developer account to install the developer betas.",ultimatepocket.com,0.021936247,0.03799509,0.94006866,admin,[],False,,0

Apple has released the fourth betas of iOS and iPadOS 16.5; which are part of the company's ongoing testing program for its operating systems.

Developers can access the latest betas by registering for the beta testing program or updating their hardware running the beta operating systems via the Apple Developer Center. Public beta versions are also typically available through the Apple Beta Software Program shortly after developer releases.

The new iOS and iPadOS 16.5 betas; with the build number 20F5059a; follow the third updates Apple released on April 25 with build 20F5050f.

Few changes have been uncovered in iOS 16.5 so far; save for a Sports tab in the News app and asking Siri to start recording the screen.

AppleInsider and Apple strongly suggest users don't install beta operating systems or other beta software on ""mission-critical"" or primary devices; as there is the small chance of issues that could result in the loss of data. Testers should instead use secondary or non-essential hardware and ensure they have sufficient backups of their critical data at all times.

The $30 AirTag has become a popular item since its 2021 release; helping users pinpoint the locations of a wide variety of lost property. But stalkers have also deployed AirTags and similar products to shadow former love interests and other people who don’t realize they are being tracked.

“Bluetooth trackers have created tremendous user benefits; but they also bring the potential of unwanted tracking; which requires industrywide action to solve;” said Dave Burke; Google’s vice president of Engineering for Android.

It also looks at market news; market trends; and the implications of the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting. It looks at how First Republic Bank's collapse and JPMorgan Chase's purchase of First Republic is seen as a potential opportunity for investors to invest in the chip sector.,We’re likely in for another rate hike on this Wednesday’s Federal Reserve meeting. However; the signs point to just a 25-basis point increase. In today’s,"We’re likely in for another rate hike on this Wednesday’s Federal Reserve meeting. However; the signs point to just a 25-basis point increase.

In today’s video; Amber and I are forecasting what this means for inflation this summer (and where the market may go from here!).

I’m predicting that one sector will be making a big rebound soon — and that’s tech stocks.

Artificial intelligence and automation continue to shape the landscape of this market. “Big-cap” tech giants like Meta; Microsoft and Apple are taking advantage of the AI trend and working through its glitches.

These companies are the most equipped to adapt this groundbreaking technology into their business models; increasing their productivity — and their profits.

And they aren’t the only ones…
• Market News: After this Wednesday’s Fed Meeting; what’s the most likely projection for interest rates and inflation in May (and the rest of 2023)? [0:30]
• Tech Byte: Why “big-cap” giants like Meta; Microsoft and Apple (and other tech companies) will benefit the most from artificial intelligence and automation software in this economic climate. [4:40]
• Big Bank Problems: An update on the March banking crisis comes from First Republic Bank; which will be bought out by JPMorgan Chase. (And why you should take measures to protect your money. Get access to my report on why now is the time to buy into bitcoin.) [6:55]
• World of Crypto: Consensus 2023 — the world’s largest; longest-running and most influential conference of crypto enthusiasts highlights blockchain technology this year. And how it’s being used to fight AI deepfakes and other internet scams. [11:00]
• Mega Trend: Following up on Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) — Its new 615-kilowatt; long-range supercharger could be a huge game-changer for EVs. If you’re an EV driver; find out what this means for you! [15:50]
• Investment Opportunity: Gary; one of our loyal readers; sold TSLA for $180 per share. But he’s ultimately bullish on the stock. So what is a good for TSLA? [20:25]

What do you think about the tech sector? Think it’s a good space to invest; or not really your thing?

Or do you actually want to learn more? Just let us know at BanyanEdge@BanyanHill.com.

But you should know that my latest research points to a major convergence (or an economic boom) in one key area of the tech sector — microchips.

This is the technology that fuels most of our lives; such as:
• Medical equipment; and much more.

That’s why there’s a chip war happening in this sector. And there are 3 ways semiconductors are going to fuel an economic boom — in the U.S.; and even on a global scale.

Some are calling it “the new oil” because this industry has a projected $1 trillion value by 2030.

So in my latest report — Chip Wars — my team and I have pinpointed select stocks that are gearing up for 1000% to as high as 5000% gains in the next 12 months or more.

If you want my full report on how to invest and profit from the chip sector; go here now for more details!

Official Collapse of First Republic Bank

Well; we have one less thing to worry about.

After two months of teetering; regulators took over First Republic Bank on Sunday and its assets have been sold to JPMorgan Chase.

First Republic’s demise amounts to the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history. It surpasses Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and ranks just behind the 2008 failure of Washington Mutual.

We can put a pin in the longer story — whether the JPMorgan takeover was “fair;” or if this was another case of a large; politically-connected bank getting a sweetheart deal. And we can similarly hold on to this question: if it’s wise to allow any single bank to become as powerful as JPMorgan is today.

For our immediate purposes; the sale is a good thing. It removes the lingering threat (at least for now) of a disorderly failure that could have led to regional banks falling like dominos. JPMorgan’s actions provided a very useful backstop.

Banks have been retrenching for months. Consumers gorged themselves on cheap credit in 2021 and early 2022; and the banks were happy to oblige. But as interest rates rose and lending standards got stricter; credit card and other revolving consumer loans started to go into decline in October last year.

Commercial loans are larger and tend to have a more cumbersome review process. Yet despite this; the drop-off in commercial lending has increased.

The amount lent in commercial and industrial loans has been in freefall since last June. And it’s worth noting that this data only goes through March. Any fallout from the failures of Silicon Valley Bank; Signature Bank and First Republic Bank wouldn’t be showing up in the data yet.

It’s important to remember that the Federal Reserve doesn’t actually “print” money; even though we often refer to their stimulative activities as money printing.

Depending on how exactly you measure money; only 10% to 20% of cash takes the form of physical bills and coins. Most dollars are blips on a screen that are lent into circulation.

So less lending by the banks means less money floating around in the economy; and ultimately; means less growth.

Does this mean we’re in for a recession?

The Conference Board; who produces the Leading Indicators Index; is currently assigning a 99% probability of a recession over the next 12 months.

A recession is not the end of the world. We need a recession every now and then to reset the clock; so to speak.

Recessions lower inflation and weed out struggling businesses; which gives a longer runway for strong businesses to grow. And it’s during hard times that new and exciting innovations get put to work.

I expect the next recession to turbocharge some of the trends that Ian has already been writing about for months; or even years now; including automation and artificial intelligence.

Although the update is a bit late to the party; the (relatively small) Sweden-based studio likely had its hands full optimizing the music-creation suite for Apple Silicon; which Apple introduced in late 2020. Competitor Ableton Live didn’t launch M1 support until February 2022; and even Apple’s Logic Pro didn’t run natively on the company’s chipset until a year after the first M1 Macs’ arrival.

Reason 12.6 also includes a new offline mode; which should be welcome news for frequent fliers; off-grid adventurers or anyone with sketchy internet service. After logging in with an online connection to authenticate; the software will continue working offline without requiring extra third-party software.

The 12.6 update is free for owners of Reason 12 and subscribers of Reason+ (a $20 / mo. service that includes Reason; an up-to-date sound bank and the Reason rack).

This is a huge news; and the safety should always be the first priority.,Apple and Google are trying to push the iphone; aii; and aii.

According to the official press release; this specification is intended to alert users in the event of suspicious suspicious behaviours. Location tracking devices can be bad news; especially if you do not place your keys or your wallet a bit. They can be used to find a way to escape trafficking. The proposed specification is intended to reduce the misuse of these gadgets.

My colleague analyzed apple air tags to identify his wife and kids for science. These are the ones of her takeaways.

So how will this standard work? Also; it would allow Bluetooth-abled gadgets to function with unauthorized tracking and alerts across iOS and Android ecosystems. They already received support from Tile; Samsung; Eufy Security; Pebblebee; Chipolo and more. Apple and Google submitted this proposed specification to the Internet Engineering Task Force; also known as IETF; that was formed in 1986. After they’ve reviewed the feedback; they will release the specification in production.

The specification; in the hands of the IETF; is the first industry-led effort to address the problem of unwanted Bluetooth trackers. It defines a set of recommendations and requirements for the ways that manufacturers should design their devices to behave both when they are in proximity to their owner and when they’re separated from the owner’s device. The key requirement is for trackers to have the ability to determine when they have been separated from their device for a set period of time and then play a sound to alert non-owners that the tracker is moving with them. The draft specification will now work its way through the process of potentially becoming an IETF Internet standard; and manufacturers can adopt any of the best practices and recommendations they want at any point.,Apple and Google have submitted a draft IETF specification to alert users when they are being tracked by Bluetooth accessories such as AirTags.,"Apple and Google have developed a draft framework to enable product manufacturers to detect and alert users when small devices such as AirTags are tracking their movements surreptitiously. The specification; which is in the hands of the IETF; is the first industry-led effort to address the problem of unwanted Bluetooth trackers.

Small location-enabled Bluetooth devices such as AirTags; Tile; Pebblebee; and others offer users the ability to track items such as keys; wallets; luggage; or pretty much anything they want. The trackers are usually quite small and are relatively inexpensive; so they have become very popular among both legitimate users as well as bad actors who want to track people or physical objects for malicious purposes. Privacy advocates and groups that work with domestic abuse victims have warned about the ways in which criminals can abuse these trackers to surveil people without their knowledge.

The new specification defines a set of recommendations and requirements for the ways that manufacturers should design their devices to behave both when they’re in proximity to their owner and when they’re separated from the owner. The key requirement is for trackers to have the ability to determine when they’ve been separated from the owner’s device for a set period of time and then play a sound to alert non-owners that the tracker is moving with them. The trackers also must have a mechanism to allow non-owners to find them.

“Bluetooth trackers have created tremendous user benefits but also bring the potential of unwanted tracking; which requires industry-wide action to solve;” said Dave Burke; vice president of engineering for Android at Google.

Among the other components of the draft specification is a pairing registry that would store information about the owner of a specific accessory at the time that it’s paired with a device. That data would include the email address and phone number of the owner; and obfuscated data would be available to the platform provider; for example Apple.

The companies submitted the draft specification to the Internet Engineering Task Force on Tuesday and it will now work its way through the process of potentially becoming an IETF Internet standard. That process can take years; but manufacturers can adopt any of the best practices and recommendations they want at any point.

“Formalizing a set of best practices for manufacturers will allow for scalable compatibility with unwanted tracking detection technologies on various smartphone platforms and improve privacy and security for individuals;” the draft says.

“Unwanted tracking detection can both detect and alert individuals that a location tracker separated from the owner's device is traveling with them; as well as provide means to find and disable the tracker.”

Lawmakers have held many hearings about online tracking and surveillance in the last few years; but those have focused almost exclusively on the ways that platform providers and ad tech companies track people across the web. The individualized; targeted surveillance that small Bluetooth-enabled trackers can allow is a different story altogether and not one that’s easily addressed by regulations or legislation. Which is why industry initiatives such as this draft specification are vital.

“A key element to reducing misuse is a universal; OS-level solution that is able to detect trackers made by different companies on the variety of smartphones that people use every day;” said Alexandra Reeve Givens; president and CEO of the Center for Democracy and Technology.",duo.com,0.058295853,0.029803697,0.91190046,,[],False,,0

The tech companies banded together to draft an “industry specification to help combat the misuse of Bluetooth location-tracking devices for unwanted tracking;” according to a press release.

The specification will allow the location-tracking devices to be compatible with unauthorized tracking detection and alerts; which will allow users to be notified if they are being tracked by an AirTag.

Samsung; Tile; Chipolo; eufy Security; and Pebblebee have all expressed support for the draft specification; according to the release.

The Apple AirTag is a coin-size device that allows a user to track the whereabouts of their technology in real-time on an iPhone app. However; the device has been utilized for more nefarious reasons; with multiple users reporting that it has been used for stalking since it went on sale in 2021; according to CNBC.

While the AirTag and iPhone app has been set up with proactive features to discourage unwanted tracking; the draft will suggest that Android users will also soon gain the same protections.

“We built AirTag and the Find My network with a set of proactive features to discourage unwanted tracking — a first in the industry — and we continue to make improvements to help ensure the technology is being used as intended;” Ron Huang; Apple’s vice president of Sensing and Connectivity; said in the press release.

“This new industry specification builds upon the AirTag protections; and through collaboration with Google results in a critical step forward to help combat unwanted tracking across iOS and Android;” he added.

This specification is intended to “alert users in the event of suspected unwanted tracking;” according to the official press release. Location-tracking devices can be a godsend; especially when you misplace your keys or wallet. However; they can also be used for far more nefarious reasons like stalking and car theft. This proposed specification is meant to squash the misuse of these gadgets.

So; how will this standard work? Well; it would allow Bluetooth-enabled gadgets to be compatible with unauthorized tracking detection and alerts across both iOS and Android ecosystems. They’ve already got the support of Tile; Samsung; Eufy Security; Pebblebee; Chipolo; and more. Apple and Google submitted this proposed specification to the Internet Engineering Task Force (otherwise known as IETF); which is a standards organization that was established back in 1986. Interested parties are currently being invited to review and comment on the proposal over a period of three months. Once they’ve gone over the feedback; they’ll release a production implement of the specification; which is expected by the end of 2023.

Since the release of the new AirTags in 2021; Apple has gone ahead and implemented a couple of new anti-stalking features. The device will now producer louder alert sounds when separated from from its owner. You’ll also see a warning message when setting up the AirTag for the first time. This new message informs folks that using this item to track people is indeed a criminal offense in most places around the world. While these changes are no doubt important; Google and Apple seem to be taking things a step further. This is great news; as safety should always be a top priority.",hotgossip24.com,0.12784228,0.023271864,0.8488859,Billy,[],True,,0

Assuming all conditions to closing are met; the Company anticipates acquiring the hotel in Cleveland during the second quarter 2023 and the hotel in Madison following completion of construction; which is expected to occur in early 2024.

During the first quarter 2023; the Company repaid in full four secured mortgage loans for a total of approximately $37 million; increasing the number of unencumbered hotels in the Company's portfolio as of March 31; 2023; to 205.

The Company has in place a Share Repurchase Program that provides for share repurchases in open market transactions.

Based on the Company's common stock closing price of $14.87 on May 1; 2023; the current annualized monthly cash distribution of $0.96 per common share represents an annual yield of approximately 6.5%. While the Company currently expects monthly distributions to continue; each distribution is subject to approval by the Company's Board of Directors. The Company's Board of Directors; in consultation with management; will continue to monitor the Company's distribution rate and timing relative to the performance of its hotels; capital improvement needs; varying economic cycles; acquisitions; dispositions; other cash requirements and the Company's REIT status for federal income tax purposes; and may make adjustments as it deems appropriate.

The Company is providing its operational and financial outlook for 2023; which is unchanged from the 2023 outlook previously provided. Given the current level of visibility into future performance as a result of short-term booking windows for the Company's portfolio of rooms-focused hotels and meaningful macroeconomic uncertainty; this outlook reflects a broad range of Comparable Hotels RevPAR Change; which is the change in Comparable Hotels RevPAR in 2023 compared to 2022; and other key metrics for 2023. This outlook is based on management's current view and does not take into account any unanticipated developments in its business or changes in its operating environment; nor does it take into account any unannounced hotel acquisitions or dispositions. Results for the first quarter 2023 benefited significantly from the easier comparison to the first quarter 2022 when the Omicron variant negatively impacted lodging demand. The high end of the full year range reflects relatively steady macroeconomic conditions throughout 2023; with continued strength in leisure demand and improvement in business transient. The low end of the range reflects a softening of the economy beginning in the second quarter with Comparable Hotels RevPAR Change roughly flat compared to 2022 in the second half of the year. Comparable Hotels RevPAR Change and Comparable Hotels Adjusted Hotel EBITDA Margin % guidance include properties acquired; as if the hotels were owned as of January 1; 2022; and exclude dispositions and assets held for sale since January 1; 2022. For the full year 2023; the Company anticipates its 2023 results will be in the following range:

Reconciliation of Net Income to EBITDA; EBITDAre; Adjusted EBITDAre and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA 

(Unaudited) 

(in thousands)

EBITDA is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries and is defined as net income (loss) excluding interest; income taxes; depreciation and amortization. The Company believes EBITDA is useful to investors because it helps the Company and its investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of the Company by removing the impact of its capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization). In addition; certain covenants included in the agreements governing the Company's indebtedness use EBITDA; as defined in the specific credit agreement; as a measure of financial compliance.

In addition to EBITDA; the Company also calculates and presents EBITDAre in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (""Nareit""); which defines EBITDAre as EBITDA; excluding gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets (including gains and losses from change in control); plus real estate related impairments; and adjustments to reflect the entity's share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated affiliates. The Company presents EBITDAre because it believes that it provides further useful information to investors in comparing its operating performance between periods and between REITs that report EBITDAre using the Nareit definition.

The Company also considers the exclusion of non-cash straight-line operating ground lease expense from EBITDAre useful; as this expense does not reflect the underlying performance of the related hotels (Adjusted EBITDAre).

The Company further excludes actual corporate-level general and administrative expense for the Company from Adjusted EBITDAre (Adjusted Hotel EBITDA) to isolate property-level operational performance over which the Company's hotel operators have direct control. The Company believes Adjusted Hotel EBITDA provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding operating performance and is used by management to measure the performance of the Company's hotels and effectiveness of the operators of the hotels.

The following table reconciles the Company's GAAP net income to EBITDA; EBITDAre; Adjusted EBITDAre and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA on a quarterly basis for 2019; 2022 and 2023:

Apple Hospitality REIT; Inc. 

Reconciliation of Net Income to FFO and MFFO 

(Unaudited) 

(in thousands)

The Company calculates and presents FFO in accordance with standards established by Nareit; which defines FFO as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP); excluding gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets (including gains and losses from change in control); extraordinary items as defined by GAAP; and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles; plus real estate related depreciation; amortization and impairments; and adjustments for unconsolidated affiliates. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions; most real estate industry investors consider FFO to be helpful in evaluating a real estate company's operations. The Company further believes that by excluding the effects of these items; FFO is useful to investors in comparing its operating performance between periods and between REITs that report FFO using the Nareit definition. FFO as presented by the Company is applicable only to its common shareholders; but does not represent an amount that accrues directly to common shareholders.

The Company calculates MFFO by further adjusting FFO for the exclusion of amortization of finance ground lease assets; amortization of favorable and unfavorable operating leases; net and non-cash straight-line operating ground lease expense; as these expenses do not reflect the underlying performance of the related hotels. The Company presents MFFO when evaluating its performance because it believes that it provides further useful supplemental information to investors regarding its ongoing operating performance.

The following table reconciles the Company's GAAP net income to FFO and MFFO for the three months ended March 31; 2023 and 2022:

Although the Company believes the expectations reflected in the forecasts are based upon reasonable assumptions; there can be no assurance that the expectations will be achieved or that the results will not be materially different. Risks that may affect these assumptions and forecasts include; but are not limited to; the following: changes in political; economic; competitive and specific market conditions; the amount and timing of acquisitions and dispositions of hotel properties; the level of capital expenditures may change significantly; which will directly affect the level of depreciation expense; interest expense and net income; the amount and timing of debt repayments may change significantly based on market conditions; which will directly affect the level of interest expense and net income; the amount and timing of transactions involving the Company's common stock may change based on market conditions; and other risks and uncertainties associated with the Company's business described herein and in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission; including the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31; 2022.

This is a patch that attempts to quickly fix bugs before a major software update arrives and is available for the latest versions of operating systems.

At Apple’s annual developer conference last year; “Quick Security Answers” was announced as one of the new features iOS 16 would bring. ; is to provide important security fixes.

These are Apple’s latest update to their updates; patching security vulnerabilities that pop up in between regular updates. The first patch was rolled out Monday; May 1; for iOS 16.1; iPadOS 16.41; and macOS 13.3.1. If a security vulnerability actively threatens Apple users; chances are the company will expedite the new update. If you want to keep your iPhone; iPad; or Mac fully up to date at all times; you'll want to check for patches regularly.,Apple is rolling out a new type of security update for your iPhone; iPad; and Mac.,"Look; I like software updates; and I’m not alone—some of us enjoy seeing what new features developers have cooked up. But even though they’re less exciting; I’m an even bigger fan of security updates...and Apple is introducing a new type of security update for iPhones; iPads; and Macs. It’s called Rapid Security Responses.



Rapid Security Responses are Apple’s latest update to their updates. Rather than deliver any new features or major software changes; Rapid Security Responses patch security vulnerabilities that pop up in between regular updates. If Apple or a third-party discover a security issue with Safari; the WebKit framework stack; or critical system libraries across Apple devices; the company can patch the issue and deliver it to users as soon as possible.

The first patch rolled out Monday; May 1; for iOS 16.4.1; iPadOS 16.4.1; and macOS 13.3.1. After running into an issue which prevented the patch from installing; the first Rapid Security Response is installing fine—although Apple isn’t specific about what’s actually in it.

As security-focused as Apple is; its prior approach to patches wasn’t the best. Other operating systems like Android separated their software updates from their security updates. That way; whenever Google would patch a critical security flaw; they could quickly issue it through their security update channel. Apple; on the other hand; usually waited until there was enough of a reason to update everyone’s iPhones; unless the issue was so dangerous they needed to push an update; which would then change the entire OS version. (That’s why we sometimes see weird versions of Apple’s software; like iOS 16.4.1. That’s a version of iOS 16.4 that needed to include security patches before an iOS 16.5 was ready.) The one caveat was Safari; which; on Mac at least; Apple would issue security updates separately for as needed.

To be clear; Rapid Security Responses aren’t for every Apple device. Rather; they’re available starting with iOS 16.4.1; iPadOS 16.4.1; and macOS 13.3.1. If your iPhone; iPad; or Mac isn’t running the latest software; you won’t have the option to install the latest Rapid Security Response; and you’ll need to wait for the next major update to reap the security benefits. That said; if a security vulnerability actively threatens Apple users; chances are the company will expedite the new update.

You can even uninstall security updates in the event something goes wrong. You won’t want to do this unless the update messes with your device; though; since you’ll risk exposing yourself to the security vulnerabilities that the update patches.

How to install Rapid Security Responses on your iPhone; iPad; or Mac

Apple; by default; grants your iPhone; iPad; or Mac permission to install Rapid Security Responses automatically. That’s obviously a good thing; but it isn’t foolproof: Like traditional automatic updates from Apple; Rapid Security Responses might not update right away; even with this setting enabled. If you want to keep your iPhone; iPad; or Mac fully up to date at all times; you’ll want to check for patches regularly.

It’s easy to do; since Rapid Security Responses appear in your device’s Software Updates page. On iOS and iPadOS; that’s under Settings > General > Software Update; while on Mac; that’s System Settings > Software Update. You can install it like any other software update.

The Rapid Security Response shows up with the same version number as the latest iOS; iPadOS; or macOS update; but with an (a) attached to differentiate itself. For example; this latest update shows up on iPhone as iOS 16.4.1 (a).",lifehacker.com,0.036794383,0.10002971,0.8631759,Jake Peterson,[],False,,0

But sometimes; unfortunately; they are also used to secretly spy on people. Apple and Google have now jointly proposed an industry standard to prevent stalking with such devices.

Like Apple in one press release announced that other companies such as Samsung; Tile; Chipolo; eufy Security and Pebblebee have also expressed their support for the draft specification announced to ensure that Bluetooth tracking devices such as AirTags cannot be misused.

The industry standard is the first of its kind and makes it possible to detect unwanted tracking and send alerts across iOS and Android platforms.

Recently; cases of undesired tracking with Bluetooth trackers such as Apple’s AirTags have become known. Apple has taken measures to prevent stalking with AirTags; such as a warning tone when someone else’s AirTag is in the vicinity of another person for a certain period of time.

Potential victims also receive instructions on their iPhone on how to turn off the alien AirTag in their area. However; this anti-stalking protection only works if everyone involved is using an iPhone. However; that is about to change.

“A first in the industry”

“Apple launched AirTag to give users the confidence to find their most important items;” said Ron Huang; Apple’s vice president of sensing and connectivity. AirTag and the Find My network have been equipped with a number of proactive features to prevent unwanted tracking – an industry first. The company also continues to work on improvements to ensure the technology is used as intended.

“This new industry standard builds on AirTag’s defenses and; in collaboration with Google; is a critical step forward to combat unwanted tracking on iOS and Android;” said Huang.

“Bluetooth trackers have brought tremendous benefits to users; but they also harbor the potential for unwanted tracking that only cross-industry efforts can solve;” said Dave Burke; Google’s vice president of engineering for Android. “Android is relentless in protecting users and will continue to develop strong protections and work with the industry to combat Bluetooth tracker abuse.”

Today’s release of a draft specification is a welcome step in addressing the harmful misuse of Bluetooth location devices; said Alexandra Reeve Givens; President and CEO of the Center for Democracy & Technology.

Companies interested in the draft industry standard have three months to review and comment. By the end of 2023; Apple and Google want to publish an implementation of the standard that prevents unwanted tracking through warnings. This will be supported in future versions of the iOS and Android mobile operating systems.",apkrig.com,0.21007007,0.017387332,0.77254266,Fiona Smith,[],False,,0

Apple and Google on Tuesday proposed a tech standard to make sure people get tipped off when their movements are being tracked with Bluetooth devices like AirTags or Tile.

The tech titans behind rival mobile operating systems that; together; power most of the world's smartphones said the ""first-of-its-kind"" specification has backing of Samsung; Tile and others.

Small location devices intended as a way for people to find backpacks; laptops; keys; handbags or other items have been used by stalkers to secretly track people such as ex-romantic partners.

""Bluetooth trackers have created tremendous user benefits; but they also bring the potential of unwanted tracking; which requires industry-wide action to solve;"" Google vice president of Android engineering Dave Burke said in a joint release.

A proposal Apple and Google submitted to a leading internet standards development organization would make Bluetooth tracking devices compatible with detection and alert systems in iOS and Android mobile software.

If adopted as a standard; Bluetooth tracking device makers would have the option of building the capabilities into their products.

""This new industry specification builds upon the AirTag protections; and through collaboration with Google results in a critical step forward to help combat unwanted tracking across iOS and Android;"" Apple vice president of sensing and connectivity Ron Huang said in the release.

Conceived as an aid for the absent-minded; AirTag sensors have been diverted towards more sinister ends; with manufacturer Apple facing anger—and lawsuits—over their use as a stalking tool.

The silver and white gadget the size of a large coin is ""an easy way to keep track of your stuff;"" the Apple website boasts. Customers can attach it to their keys; a wallet or a backpack.

When linked to a smartphone app; a $29 AirTag helps users detect their belongings' real-time location in case they get lost—but the transmitter can also trail the humans carrying those items.

Unwanted surveillance is a common tactic of abuse; according to Erica Olsen; senior director of the Safety Net Project at the National Network to End Domestic Violence.

""It's imperative for advocates and technology companies to work together on solutions to minimize the opportunities for misuse;"" Olsen said of Bluetooth trackers.

Center for Democracy and Technology chief executive Alexandra Reeve Givens commended Apple and Google for collaborating on a way to improve detection of unwanted tracking devices.

""We look forward to the specification moving through the standardization process;"" Reeve Givens said.",techxplore.com,0.08907353,0.04154457,0.8693819,Science X,[],True,,0

Apple’s AirTags; coin-sized gadgets equipped with Bluetooth technology; are popular with travelers but have also been implicated in harassment cases.

Connected to a mobile application; they make it possible to follow in real time the geographical position of the goods to which they are attached; but also of the humans who transport it; sometimes without their knowledge.

iPhones already notify their users if they detect a nearby AirTag (or Apple wireless earbuds) that doesn’t belong to them while on the move.

The proposal of the two technology giants should serve to harmonize the technical specifications of Bluetooth beacons from other companies to alert individuals regardless of the operating system of their smartphone (iOS for Apple and Android for Google).

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Apple and Google are teaming up to thwart unwanted tracking through Bluetooth devices that were created to help people find lost keys; keep tabs on luggage or to locate other things that have a tendency to be misplaced or lost.

Mrs. Criticos’ family was also in on the surprise. Because of them; she knows how important it is to be prepared for an emergency because many of them work in Public Safety.

“It’s one of those things; I take the training and hope to never use it; but I’m glad I do the training. It’s important everyone is trained on the Heimlich maneuver;” Criticos says.

And everyone is thankful this teacher took the time to learn. “She was so calm and with all the other students in the room she kept them calm as well. She did what she needed to do and saved his life in my opinion. She’s a hero; really is a hero.” says Principal Arvizzigno.",rochesterfirst.com,0.13316272,0.036346942,0.8304903,Katrina Irwin,[],False,,0

The two companies behind the iPhone and the software that powers Android phones on Tuesday submitted a proposal to set standards for combatting secret surveillance on Apple's AirTag trackers and similar gadgets. The concept also has the backing of Samsung; which sells the most Android smartphones worldwide; as well as tracking products similar to the AirTag such as Tile; Chipolo; and Pebblebee.

The $30 AirTag has become a popular item since its 2021 release; helping users pinpoint the locations of a wide variety of lost property. But stalkers have also deployed AirTags and similar products to shadow former love interests and other people who don't realize they are being tracked.

""Bluetooth trackers have created tremendous user benefits; but they also bring the potential of unwanted tracking; which requires industrywide action to solve;"" said Dave Burke; Google's vice president of Engineering for Android.

Apple and AirTag hope to have a plan in place by the end of this year to thwart stealth tracking. The solution would be distributed through software updates to iPhones and Android phones.

Erica Olsen; the senior director of National Network to End Domestic Violence's Safety Net Project; applauded the effort to set an industry standard that she believes will help protect survivors of abusive relationships and other people that have been targets of stealth technology. ""These new standards will minimize opportunities for abuse of this technology and decrease the burden on survivors in detecting unwanted trackers;"" Olsen said.",ksl.com,0.22739556,0.024267605,0.7483368,Deseret Digital Media,[],True,,0

Today Apple and Google jointly submitted a proposed industry specification to help combat the misuse of Bluetooth location-tracking devices for unwanted tracking. The first-of-its-kind specification will allow Bluetooth location-tracking devices to be compatible with unauthorized tracking detection and alerts across iOS and Android platforms. Samsung; Tile; Chipolo; eufy Security; and Pebblebee have expressed support for the draft specification; which offers best practices and instructions for manufacturers; should they choose to build these capabilities into their products.

The posted IETF draft specifies that devices that discover an unwanted tracker should be able to physically locate it via sound; that such devices make a sound if they’re in motion; and more. While the proposal is from Apple and Google; the press release says that the makers of similar products—Samsung; Tile; Chipolo; eufy; and Pebblebee—have “expressed support” for the proposal.

The goal; ultimately; is to make it so that all iPhones and Android phones can detect all trackers and alert you to their presence. The release includes supportive quotes from the National Network to End Domestic Violence and the Center for Democracy & Technology. According to Apple and Google; the goal is to release the “production implementation” of the specification by the end of the year.
